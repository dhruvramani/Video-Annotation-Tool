"2","1","1","Sheldon","There's no point, I just think it's a good idea for a T-shirt.","00:00:14,400","00:00:17,600",True
"3","1","1","Receptionist","If you have to ask, maybe you shouldn't be here.","00:00:58,900","00:01:01,600",True
"4","1","1","Leonard","Sheldon, this was your idea. A little extra money to get fractional T-1 bandwidth in the apartment.","00:01:42,800","00:01:48,000",False
"5","1","1","Sheldon","I know, and I do yearn for faster downloads. But there's some poor woman who's gonna pin her hopes on my sperm. What if she winds up with a toddler who doesn't know if he should use an integral or a differential to solve the area under a curve?","00:01:48,100","00:02:01,700",True
"6","1","1","Leonard","I don't know... I've never reneged on a proffer of sperm before.","00:02:13,300","00:02:16,500",True
"7","1","1","Sheldon","You want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?","00:02:41,000","00:02:43,900",True
"8","1","1","Sheldon","No, it's true, I did a series of experiments when I was 12. My father broke his clavicle.","00:02:55,300","00:02:59,300",True
"9","1","1","Leonard","Is that why they sent you to boarding school?","00:03:00,700","00:03:02,600",False
"10","1","1","Sheldon","No. That was a result of my work with lasers.","00:03:02,700","00:03:05,400",True
"11","1","1","Leonard","We don't mean to interrupt. We live across the hall.","00:03:30,300","00:03:32,500",False
"12","1","1","Leonard","I think we should be good neighbors and invite her over, make her feel welcome.","00:04:21,900","00:04:25,800",False
"13","1","1","Sheldon","I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on MySpace.","00:04:33,800","00:04:38,900",True
"14","1","1","Penny","So, what do you guys do for fun around here?","00:05:50,600","00:05:53,000",False
"15","1","1","Penny","This looks like some serious stuff. - Leonard, did you do this? - Actually, that's my work.","00:06:34,300","00:06:39,300",True
"16","1","1","Sheldon","Yeah. Well, it's just some quantum mechanics with a little string theory doodling around the edges. That part there, that's just a joke. It's a spoof of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation.","00:06:41,200","00:06:50,700",True
"17","1","1","Penny","So you're like one of those Beautiful Mind genius guys.","00:06:52,100","00:06:55,400",False
"18","1","1","Sheldon","If by ""holy smokes"", you mean a derivative restatement of the kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men's room at MIT, sure.","00:07:06,100","00:07:12,700",True
"19","1","1","Leonard","At least I didn't have to invent 26 dimensions just to make the math come out.","00:07:19,100","00:07:23,000",True
"20","1","1","Sheldon","In the winter, that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm, and yet not so close as to cause perspiration In the summer, it's directly in the path of a cross-breeze created by opening windows there and there. It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, thus discouraging conversation, nor so far wide as to create a parallax distortion. I could go on, but I think I've made my point.","00:07:46,000","00:08:06,100",True
"21","1","1","Sheldon","That's not true. Koothrappali and Wolowitz come over all the time.","00:08:44,100","00:08:46,800",False
"22","1","1","Leonard","Yeah. It's like regular Boggle, but... in Klingon.","00:09:00,400","00:09:04,000",True
"23","1","1","Leonard","That's probably enough about us. So, tell us about you.","00:09:07,400","00:09:10,300",False
"24","1","1","Leonard","I think what Sheldon's trying to say is that Sagittarius wouldn't have been our first guess.","00:09:31,000","00:09:35,900",False
"25","1","1","Penny","Yeah, a lot of people think I'm a water sign. Okay, let's see, what else. I'm a vegetarian. Except for fish. And the occasional steak. I love steak!","00:09:36,400","00:09:45,500",True
"26","1","1","Leonard","Well... do you have some sort of a job?","00:09:55,600","00:09:57,900",True
"27","1","1","Sheldon","It took you 4 years to get through high school?","00:10:57,900","00:11:00,000",True
"28","1","1","Leonard","Should I say something? I feel like I should say something.","00:11:10,400","00:11:13,000",False
"29","1","1","Leonard","No, it's not crazy. It's a... It's a paradox. Paradoxes are part of nature. Think about light. If you look at Huygens, light is a wave, as confirmed by the double-slit experiments, but then along comes Albert Einstein and discovers that light behaves like particles, too.","00:11:28,100","00:11:47,100",False
"31","1","1","Penny","I'm so sorry. I'm such a mess. On top of everything else, I'm all gross from moving and my stupid shower doesn't even work.","00:11:53,700","00:12:00,000",True
"32","1","1","Penny","Really? Would it be totally weird if I used it?","00:12:03,000","00:12:05,000",False
"33","1","1","Sheldon","It has been some time since we've had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment.","00:12:27,000","00:12:31,000",True
"34","1","1","Leonard","That's not true. Remember at Thanksgiving, my grandmother with Alzheimer's had that episode?","00:12:31,800","00:12:36,200",False
"35","1","1","Sheldon","Point taken. It has been some time since we've had a woman take her clothes off, after which we didn't want to rip our eyes out.","00:12:38,300","00:12:44,400",True
"36","1","1","Leonard","The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.","00:12:45,800","00:12:48,700",True
"37","1","1","Sheldon","So what exactly are you trying to accomplish here?","00:12:49,700","00:12:52,600",False
"38","1","1","Leonard","I'm not trying to have sex with her.","00:12:57,100","00:12:59,400",False
"39","1","1","Leonard","What makes you think she wouldn't have sex with me? I'm a male and she's a female.","00:13:02,800","00:13:07,100",False
"40","1","1","Leonard","I'm not going to engage in hypotheticals here. I'm just trying to be a good neighbor.","00:13:10,800","00:13:15,000",False
"41","1","1","Sheldon","Do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered when she discovers your Luke Skywalker no-more-tears shampoo?","00:13:26,800","00:13:32,600",True
"42","1","1","Howard","It's a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.","00:13:46,900","00:13:51,000",False
"43","1","1","Leonard","And she's not a lady. She's just a new neighbor.","00:14:10,100","00:14:12,600",False
"44","1","1","Howard","And you want us out because you're anticipating coitus?","00:14:16,500","00:14:19,600",True
"45","1","1","Howard","It's French for ""good shower. "" It's a sentiment I can express in six languages.","00:15:01,100","00:15:05,700",True
"46","1","1","Leonard","Sure, you can ask me a favor. I would do you a favor for you.","00:15:31,800","00:15:34,900",True
"47","1","1","Penny","It's just not the kind of thing you ask a guy you just met.","00:15:40,200","00:15:43,500",False
"48","1","1","Sheldon","I really think we should examine the chain of causality here.","00:15:53,800","00:15:56,800",False
"49","1","1","Sheldon","A beautiful woman stands naked in our shower. Event B... we drive halfway across town to retrieve a television set from the aforementioned woman's ex-boyfriend. Query... on what plane of existence is there even a semi-rational link between these events?","00:15:58,400","00:16:11,700",False
"50","1","1","Leonard","She asked me to do her a favor, Sheldon.","00:16:12,900","00:16:15,200",False
"51","1","1","Sheldon","Yes, well, that may be the proximal cause of our journey, but we both know it only exists in contradistinction to the higher level distal cause.","00:16:15,500","00:16:22,500",False
"52","1","1","Leonard","That's a biological impossibility. And you didn't have to come.","00:16:26,200","00:16:29,700",True
"53","1","1","Leonard","Come on, you know how it is with breakups.","00:16:37,400","00:16:39,300",False
"54","1","1","Sheldon","You did not break up with Joyce Kim. She defected to North Korea.","00:16:44,300","00:16:47,500",True
"55","1","1","Sheldon","Leonard, the two of us can't even carry a TV.","00:17:08,800","00:17:11,400",True
"56","1","1","Penny","So, you guys work with Leonard and Sheldon at the university?","00:17:13,600","00:17:16,500",False
"57","1","1","Howard","He speaks English. He just can't speak to women.","00:17:25,100","00:17:27,800",True
"58","1","1","Leonard","We're not going to give up just like that.","00:17:54,200","00:17:56,100",False
"59","1","1","Leonard","Excuse me. If I were to give up on the first little hitch, I never would have identified the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the Big Bang.","00:18:00,800","00:18:08,300",True
"60","1","1","Sheldon","It's just a privilege to watch your mind at work.","00:18:25,900","00:18:28,500",True
"61","1","1","Leonard","Come on, we have a combined IQ of 360. We should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building.","00:18:29,700","00:18:35,400",False
"62","1","1","Man","How the hell did you get in the building?","00:19:05,100","00:19:06,800",False
"63","1","1","Leonard","Sheldon, I am so sorry I dragged you through this.","00:19:36,600","00:19:39,400",False
"64","1","1","Sheldon","It's okay. It wasn't my first pantsing and it won't be my last.","00:19:39,600","00:19:43,300",True
"65","1","1","Leonard","Anyway, I've learned my lesson. She's out of my league, I'm done with her. Got my work, one day I'll win the Nobel Prize and then I'll die alone.","00:19:56,500","00:20:04,500",False
"66","1","1","Sheldon","Don't think like that. You're not going to die alone.","00:20:04,700","00:20:07,600",False
"67","1","1","Sheldon","And you're certainly not going to win a Nobel Prize.","00:20:12,000","00:20:14,900",True
"68","1","1","Howard","This is one of my favorite places to kick back after a quest. They have a great house ale.","00:20:15,500","00:20:20,800",True
"69","1","1","Howard","Yeah, I've had him since level ten. His name is Buttons. Anyway, if you had your own game character we could hang out, maybe go on a quest.","00:20:22,700","00:20:32,800",False
"70","1","1","Penny","I don't think I'll be able to stop thinking about it.","00:20:37,300","00:20:39,800",True
"71","1","1","Leonard","Well, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards and I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory.","00:20:48,500","00:20:53,500",True
"72","1","1","Penny","I'm so sorry. I really thought if you guys went instead of me he wouldn't be such an ass.","00:20:54,200","00:20:58,800",False
"73","1","1","Sheldon","That was a valid...? What is happening to you?","00:21:01,100","00:21:03,700",True
"74","1","1","Penny","Really, thank you so much for going and trying, you're just... You're so terrific. Really. Why don't you put some clothes on, I'll get my purse, and dinner is on me, okay?","00:21:04,900","00:21:17,000",False
"76","1","1","Sheldon","We can't have Thai food, - we had Indian for lunch. - So?","00:21:46,000","00:21:48,800",False
"78","1","1","Howard","Turn left on Lake Street and head up to Colorado. I know a wonderful little sushi bar that has karaoke.","00:22:01,700","00:22:06,700",False
"79","1","1","Sheldon","I don't know what your odds are in the world as a whole, but as far as the population of this car goes, you're a veritable mack daddy.","00:22:21,500","00:22:27,700",True
"80","1","2","Sheldon","Since it's not bee season, you can have my epinephrine.","00:00:09,700","00:00:12,300",True
"81","1","2","Sheldon","Thailand has had the fork since the latter half of the 19th Century. Interestingly  they don't put the fork in their mouth-- they use it to put the food on a spoon which then goes into their mouth.","00:00:17,600","00:00:25,900",True
"83","1","2","Leonard","So, you're coming home from work. That's great. How was work?","00:00:48,200","00:00:50,800",False
"84","1","2","Howard","- Haven't you ever been told how beautiful you are in flawless Russian?","00:01:22,500","00:01:26,200",True
"85","1","2","Sheldon","Don't take it personally, it's his pathology. He can't talk to women.","00:01:39,300","00:01:42,600",False
"86","1","2","Leonard","If you don't have any other plans, do you want to join us for Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?","00:02:04,100","00:02:08,900",False
"87","1","2","Penny","A marathon? How many Superman movies are there?","00:02:09,300","00:02:11,900",False
"88","1","2","Penny","I do like the one where Lois Lane falls from the helicopter and Superman swooshes down and catches her. Which one was that?","00:02:15,400","00:02:20,600",True
"90","1","2","Sheldon","Lois Lane is falling, accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second per second. Superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Miss Lane, who is now traveling at approximately 120 miles an hour, hits them and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces.","00:02:31,600","00:02:45,200",True
"91","1","2","Sheldon","In what space, sir? She's two feet above the ground. Frankly, if he really loved her, he'd let her hit the pavement. It'd be a more merciful death.","00:02:51,400","00:02:59,400",True
"92","1","2","Leonard","Excuse me, your entire argument is predicated on the assumption that Superman's flight is a feat of strength.","00:03:00,300","00:03:06,600",True
"93","1","2","Sheldon","Are you listening  to yourself? It is well established that his flight is a feat of strength. It is an extension of his ability to leap tall buildings, an ability he derives from exposure to Earth's yellow sun.","00:03:06,800","00:03:15,600",True
"94","1","2","Sheldon","A combination of the moon's solar reflection and the energy-storage capacity of Kryptonian skin cells.","00:03:17,800","00:03:22,600",True
"95","1","2","Leonard","Her apartment's on the fourth floor but the elevator's broken, so... You're just gonna be done? Okay. Cool. Thanks","00:04:14,200","00:04:19,500",False
"97","1","2","Leonard","We don't need strength-- we're physicists. We are the intellectual descendants of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever and I can move the Earth. It's just a matter of... I don't have this.","00:04:33,500","00:04:42,700",True
"98","1","2","Sheldon","Yes, but they all involve a green lantern and a power ring.","00:04:55,200","00:04:57,900",True
"99","1","2","Sheldon","You do understand that our efforts here will in no way increase the odds of you having sexual congress with this woman.","00:05:52,600","00:05:58,200",True
"100","1","2","Leonard","I'm doing this to be a good neighbor. In any case, there's no way it could lower the odds.","00:06:06,000","00:06:11,300",True
"104","1","2","Sheldon","The Mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy. This is chaos. Excuse me. Explain to me an organizational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid.","00:06:39,700","00:06:49,900",True
"105","1","2","Sheldon","I'm just inferring this is a couch because the evidence suggests the coffee table is having a tiny garage sale.","00:06:51,200","00:06:56,300",True
"106","1","2","Leonard","Did it ever occur to you that not everyone has the compulsive need to sort, organize and label the entire world around them?","00:06:58,000","00:07:03,900",False
"107","1","2","Sheldon","Excuse me, but I think we've both found that helpful at times.","00:07:15,500","00:07:18,100",True
"108","1","2","Sheldon","This is not your home. This is not anyone's home. This is a swirling vortex of entropy.","00:07:28,400","00:07:33,600",False
"109","1","2","Leonard","When the transvestite lived here, you didn't care how he kept the place.","00:07:35,600","00:07:38,900",False
"110","1","2","Penny","Great. Was it hard getting it up the stairs?","00:07:57,000","00:07:59,000",True
"111","1","2","Sheldon","I had no choice. I couldn't sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom was our living room, and just outside our living room was that hallway, and immediately adjacent to the hallway was... this.","00:09:31,300","00:09:41,100",True
"112","1","2","Leonard","Do you realize that if Penny wakes up, there is no reasonable explanation as to why we're here.","00:09:43,400","00:09:48,100",False
"113","1","2","Leonard","No, no, you gave me an explanation. Its reasonableness will be determined by a jury of your peers.","00:09:51,900","00:09:57,500",True
"114","1","2","Sheldon","You might want to speak in a lower register.","00:10:06,400","00:10:09,000",False
"115","1","2","Leonard","I accept your premise. Now, please, let's go.","00:10:36,900","00:10:39,600",False
"116","1","2","Sheldon","If you have time to lean, you have time to clean.","00:10:46,500","00:10:49,300",True
"117","1","2","Sheldon","I have to say I slept splendidly. Granted, not long, but just deeply and well.","00:11:04,300","00:11:10,300",True
"118","1","2","Sheldon","Granted, my methods may have been somewhat unorthodox, but I think the end result will be a measurable enhancement - to Penny's quality of life - You've convinced me.","00:11:21,800","00:11:29,700",False
"119","1","2","Penny","You came into my apartment last night while I was sleeping?!","00:12:19,400","00:12:21,800",False
"120","1","2","Sheldon","Really more to organize. You're not actually dirty, per se.","00:12:23,400","00:12:26,000",True
"121","1","2","Leonard","Oh, yes, we discussed it at length last night.","00:12:33,500","00:12:35,600",True
"122","1","2","Penny","And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?","00:12:51,000","00:12:53,900",False
"123","1","2","Sheldon","Boy, you are all over the place this morning.","00:14:02,700","00:14:05,300",True
"124","1","2","Sheldon","I have a master's and two Ph.D.s, I should not have to do this.","00:14:09,400","00:14:12,100",True
"125","1","2","Sheldon","I am truly sorry for what happened last night. I take full responsibility. And I hope that it won't color your opinion of Leonard, who is not only a wonderful guy, but also, I hear, a gentle and thorough lover.","00:14:15,100","00:14:27,600",True
"127","1","2","Penny","That's exactly what I thought. Thank you for listening. You're a doll.","00:16:02,500","00:16:06,300",False
"128","1","2","Raj","Actually, I was less the chatter than the chat-ee.","00:16:51,500","00:16:54,000",True
"129","1","2","Leonard","What did she say? Is she still mad at me?","00:16:54,900","00:16:56,900",False
"130","1","2","Raj","Well, she was upset at first, but probably because her sister shot somebody.","00:16:57,100","00:17:01,200",True
"131","1","2","Raj","But then there was something about you, and then she hugged me.","00:17:03,600","00:17:06,900",True
"133","1","2","Penny","You guys, seriously, I grew up on a farm, okay? I rebuilt a tractor engine when I was, like, 12. I think I can put together a cheap, Swedish media center.","00:18:53,800","00:19:00,500",False
"134","1","2","Leonard","No, please. We insist. It's the least we can do, considering.","00:19:00,600","00:19:03,600",False
"135","1","2","Howard","These instructions are a pictographic representation of the least imaginative way to assemble these components. This, right here is why Sweden has no space program.","00:19:10,900","00:19:19,100",True
"136","1","2","Penny","Well, it looked pretty good in the store.","00:19:20,700","00:19:22,400",False
"137","1","2","Leonard","It is an inefficient design. For example, she has a flat screen TV, which means all the space behind it is wasted.","00:19:22,700","00:19:27,700",False
"139","1","2","Howard","The PVC comes down here. Maybe a little corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here.","00:19:55,300","00:19:58,900",False
"140","1","2","Penny","It's hot in here. I think I'll just take off all my clothes.","00:20:05,800","00:20:08,300",True
"141","1","3","Leonard","Don't panic. This is what the last 97 hours have been about.","00:00:18,830","00:00:21,783",True
"142","1","3","Howard","Stay frosty. There's a horde of armed goblins on the other side of that gate guarding the Sword of Asaroth.","00:00:22,183","00:00:27,595",True
"143","1","3","Leonard","Warriors, unsheathe your weapons. Magic wielders, raise your wands.","00:00:27,942","00:00:30,961",False
"145","1","3","Howard","Sheldon, he's got Raj. Use your sleep spell!","00:01:02,560","00:01:04,592",False
"146","1","3","Sheldon","There is no more Sheldon. I am the sword master!","00:01:12,750","00:01:16,203",True
"147","1","3","Leonard","No. I can't look at you or your avatar right now.","00:02:12,400","00:02:15,400",True
"148","1","3","Sheldon","Don't forget the mail you took accidentally on purpose as an excuse to talk to her.","00:02:24,700","00:02:28,400",True
"149","1","3","Howard","Stealing snail mail-- very old school. I like it.","00:02:31,100","00:02:33,700",True
"150","1","3","Penny","Thank you. I've got to talk to that mailman.","00:02:56,100","00:02:58,100",False
"151","1","3","Howard","Kissing, what kind of kissing? Cheeks? Lips? Chaste? French?","00:03:32,700","00:03:35,700",True
"152","1","3","Sheldon","Don't tell me that your hopeless infatuation is devolving into pointless jealousy.","00:03:44,600","00:03:48,300",False
"153","1","3","Leonard","I'm done with Penny. I'm going to be more realistic and go after someone my own speed.","00:04:25,600","00:04:30,200",False
"154","1","3","Sheldon","The dietician at the cafeteria with the limp and the lazy eye?","00:04:34,000","00:04:37,200",True
"155","1","3","Howard","I don't know. You guys work in the same lab.","00:04:52,100","00:04:53,900",False
"156","1","3","Leonard","I've done it. About two seconds. 2.6 for minestrone.","00:05:37,400","00:05:40,100",True
"157","1","3","Leonard","Anyway, I was thinking more of a bio-social exploration with a neuro-chemical overlay.","00:05:46,900","00:05:51,900",False
"158","1","3","Leonard","I was going to characterize it as the modification of our colleague-slash-friendship paradigm with the addition of a date-like component, but we don't need to quibble over terminology.","00:05:57,200","00:06:06,900",True
"159","1","3","Lesley","Interesting. And would you agree that the primary way we would evaluate either the success or failure of the date would be based on the biochemical reaction during the good night kiss?","00:06:21,700","00:06:30,300",False
"160","1","3","Lesley","Why don't we just stipulate that the date goes well and move to the key variable?","00:06:33,400","00:06:37,000",False
"161","1","3","Leonard","- You proposed the experiment. I think you should present your findings first.","00:07:02,700","00:07:07,000",True
"162","1","3","Howard","Sheldon, if you were a robot, and I knew and you didn't...","00:07:37,900","00:07:42,900",True
"164","1","3","Howard","Maybe-- although the history of science fiction is not on your side.","00:07:57,600","00:08:01,100",True
"165","1","3","Sheldon","Okay, let me ask you this-- when I learn that I'm a robot, would I be bound by Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics?","00:08:02,200","00:08:09,800",True
"166","1","3","Howard","That's true. Have you ever harmed a human being or through inaction allowed a human being to come to harm?","00:08:17,800","00:08:22,300",False
"167","1","3","Howard","- Have you ever harmed yourself or allowed yourself to be harmed except in cases where a human being would have been endangered?","00:08:22,500","00:08:28,600",False
"168","1","3","Leonard","Oh, we tried kissing, but the Earth didn't move.","00:08:47,800","00:08:50,600",True
"169","1","3","Leonard","I mean, any more than the 383 miles that it was going to move anyway.","00:08:52,100","00:08:55,800",True
"170","1","3","Sheldon","Oh, I've seen that look before. This is just going to be two weeks of moping and tedious emo songs and calling me to come down to pet stores to look at cats.","00:08:58,300","00:09:07,100",True
"171","1","3","Sheldon","I don't know if I can take it.","00:09:09,500","00:09:11,000",False

"174","1","3","Howard","I think Mrs. Tishman's got her eye on you. I've been there. You're in for a treat.","00:09:51,800","00:09:57,100",False
"175","1","3","Sheldon","If you're compiling a mix CD for a double suicide. Oh, I hope that scratching post is for you.","00:10:29,000","00:10:35,600",True
"176","1","3","Leonard","I know what you're thinking. I've taken your asthma into account. There's a feline geneticist in San Diego who's developed the cutest little hypoallergenic calicos.","00:10:36,800","00:10:44,700",True
"177","1","3","Sheldon","Do you really think you can satisfy your need for a relationship with a genetically altered cat?","00:10:52,200","00:10:56,400",False
"178","1","3","Sheldon","No, no, that was not my point. My point was don't buy a cat.","00:11:45,600","00:11:50,400",True
"180","1","3","Leonard","I was wondering if you had plans for dinner.","00:12:12,000","00:12:13,900",False
"181","1","3","Leonard","There is an inherent ambiguity in the word ""dinner."" Technically it refers to the largest meal of the day whenever it's consumed. So to clarify here, by dinner I mean supper.","00:12:16,800","00:12:25,100",False
"182","1","3","Sheldon","No. The dark crescent-shaped patterns under your arms conceal it nicely.","00:13:49,100","00:13:53,400",True
"183","1","3","Sheldon","- What time is your date? - 6:30.","00:13:55,800","00:13:57,700",False
"184","1","3","Sheldon","No, well, now there's always the possibility that alcohol and poor judgment on her part might lead to a nice romantic evening.","00:14:24,000","00:14:31,200",True
"185","1","3","Leonard","You're right. Alcohol, poor judgment-- it could go well.","00:14:32,900","00:14:35,900",True
"186","1","3","Leonard","You could've stopped at ""it could go well.""","00:14:46,700","00:14:49,100",False
"187","1","3","Leonard","I mean, I'm a perfectly nice guy. There's no reason we couldn't go and have a lovely dinner, maybe take a walk afterwards, talk about things we have in common. You love pottery? I love pottery! There's a pause, we both know what's happening. I lean in, we kiss. It's a little tentative at first, but then I realize she's kissing me back. She's biting my lower lip! She wants me! This thing is going the distance! We're going to have sex! Oh, God, oh, my God!","00:14:52,600","00:15:19,000",False
"188","1","3","Sheldon","- What?! - It's a biofeedback technique. It's relaxation through brain wave manipulation. I read a paper about it in Journal of American Neuroscience. It was a little sparsely sourced, but I think the basic science is valid. I probably have it here somewhere.","00:15:43,500","00:15:55,600",True
"189","1","3","Leonard","Who am I kidding? I can't go through with this. You need to call her and cancel.","00:15:56,500","00:16:00,000",True
"191","1","3","Sheldon","I'll just tell her that you had a routine colonoscopy and haven't quite bounced back.","00:16:19,400","00:16:23,200",True
"192","1","3","Leonard","I can't, because if I don't show up she'll still be expecting you.","00:16:26,600","00:16:29,300",False
"193","1","3","Leonard","Stop asking me all these questions. I need to take another shower.","00:16:33,100","00:16:36,800",False
"194","1","3","Penny","So are the rest of the guys meeting us here?","00:16:40,200","00:16:42,000",False
"195","1","3","Leonard","We both have people in our lives who... want to nip intestinal polyps in the bud.","00:17:02,600","00:17:08,500",True
"196","1","3","Leonard","Well, with the exception of string theory, not much has happened since the 1930s. And you can't prove string theory. At best you can say, ""Hey, look, my idea has an internal logical consistency.""","00:17:22,300","00:17:34,700",True
"197","1","3","Penny","Doug? Oh, yeah, I don't know. I mean, you know, he's nice and funny, but...","00:18:04,300","00:18:08,900",False
"198","1","3","Leonard","Just say the ""but"" thing about Doug and then I'll get her back.","00:18:14,600","00:18:17,900",False
"199","1","3","Penny","No, it's usually over a weekend, and trust me, you do not feel good after it.","00:18:54,500","00:18:58,600",False
"201","1","3","Penny","You sure you don't want to go to the emergency room? No, I'm okay. It stopped bleeding.","00:20:01,500","00:20:05,800",True
"202","1","3","Penny","I know, but you did throw up. Isn't that a sign of a concussion?","00:20:06,300","00:20:09,400",False
"205","1","3","Leonard","When I take a girl on a date-- and I do-- she knows she's been dated.","00:20:56,200","00:21:03,500",True
"208","1","3","Leonard","I think I might have a little concussion. I'm gonna go lie down for a while. Good night.","00:21:13,300","00:21:17,600",True
"209","1","4","Sheldon","It's time travel, I will have already done that.","00:00:28,600","00:00:30,600",True

"212","1","4","Leonard","Then we'll avoid him, we'll meet the new department head, congratulate him, shake his hand and go.","00:00:55,500","00:00:59,700",False
"213","1","4","Sheldon","How's this? ""Pleased to meet you, Dr. Gablehauser. ""How fortunate for you that the university's ""chosen to hire you, despite the fact ""that you've done no original research in 25 years, ""and instead have written a series of popular books ""that reduce the great concepts of science ""to a series of anecdotes, ""each one dumbed down to accommodate the duration ""of an average bowel movement.","00:00:59,900","00:01:18,600",True
"214","1","4","Leonard","Well, you did call him a glorified high school science teacher whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts.","00:02:35,900","00:02:41,800",True
"215","1","4","Sheldon","I finally have time to test my hypothesis about the separation of the water molecules from the egg proteins and its impact vis-a-vis taste.","00:03:25,600","00:03:32,700",True
"216","1","4","Leonard","You know, I'm sure if you just apologize to Gablehauser, he would give you your job back.","00:03:41,900","00:03:46,000",False
"217","1","4","Sheldon","I don't want my job back. I've spent the past three and a half years staring at grease boards full of equations. Before that, I spent four years working on my thesis. Before that, I was in college, and before that, I was in the fifth grade. This is my first day off in decades and I'm going to savor it.","00:03:46,200","00:04:03,000",False

"222","1","4","Penny","Maybe it's all for the best. I always say when one door closes, another one opens.","00:05:36,900","00:05:41,000",True
"223","1","4","Sheldon","Or if the first door closing creates a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door.","00:05:49,000","00:05:53,000",True
"224","1","4","Sheldon","You're not leaving yourself enough space between cars.","00:06:01,000","00:06:03,200",False
"225","1","4","Sheldon","- No, let me do the math for you. This car weighs, let's say 4,000 pounds. Now add 140 for me, 120 for you...","00:06:03,400","00:06:10,800",True
"227","1","4","Sheldon","You want to hear an interesting thing about tomatoes?","00:07:06,600","00:07:08,800",False
"228","1","4","Sheldon","Yes, but anyone who knows anything about the dynamics of bacterial growth knows to pick up their refrigerated food on the way out of the supermarket.","00:07:13,500","00:07:19,800",True
"229","1","4","Sheldon","Well, there's some value to taking a multivitamin, but the human body can only absorb so much. What you're buying here are the ingredients for very expensive urine.","00:07:46,000","00:07:55,000",True
"230","1","4","Sheldon","Think about it. It's a product that doesn't spoil and you're going to be needing them for at least the next 30 years.","00:08:30,300","00:08:35,800",True
"231","1","4","Penny","You want me to buy 30 years worth of tampons?","00:08:36,500","00:08:39,100",True
"232","1","4","Leonard","Hey, I just ran into Penny. She seemed upset about something.","00:09:12,000","00:09:14,700",False
"233","1","4","Sheldon","I think it's her time of the month.","00:09:15,100","00:09:17,200",True
"235","1","4","Sheldon","Oh, that was a dead end. Scrambled eggs are as good as they're ever going to be.","00:09:32,800","00:09:37,100",True
"236","1","4","Sheldon","I read an article about Japanese scientists who inserted DNA from luminous jellyfish into other animals, and I thought, ""Hey, fish nightlights.""","00:09:41,500","00:09:49,600",True
"237","1","4","Leonard","- I didn't know what else to do. He's lost all focus. Every day he's got a new obsession.","00:10:34,400","00:10:40,400",True
"239","1","4","Sheldon","I was working with luminous fish, and I thought...","00:11:13,500","00:11:16,200",False
"242","1","4","Leonard","Because one of the great minds of the 21st century is raising glow-in-the-dark fish and weaving serapes.","00:11:28,400","00:11:34,100",True
"243","1","4","Leonard","Really? When was the last time you left the house?","00:11:45,500","00:11:47,700",False
"244","1","4","Sheldon","Well, then buckle up. In the next four to eight days she's going to get very crabby.","00:11:52,100","00:11:56,500",True
"245","1","4","Sheldon","Yes, well, I'm not a child-- I'm a grown man, capable of living my life as I see fit. And I certainly don't need someone telling on me to my mother!","00:12:02,100","00:12:09,700",True

"248","1","4","Mrs","- Well, poor boy had a fit. Locked himself in his room and built a sonic death ray.","00:14:20,600","00:14:26,000",True
"249","1","4","Mrs","That's what he called it. Didn't even slow down the neighbor kids.","00:14:28,500","00:14:31,600",True
"250","1","4","Mrs","It pissed our dog off to no end.","00:14:33,200","00:14:35,100",True

"253","1","4","Leonard","This is ridiculous. Damn it, Sheldon, snap out of it! You're a physicist-- You belong at the university doing research, not hiding in your room!","00:15:59,800","00:16:07,200",False
"254","1","4","Mrs","Well, that looks awful fancy. What is that?","00:16:27,600","00:16:30,000",False
"255","1","4","Mrs","You know how your daddy used to say that you can only fish for so long before you got to throw a stick of dynamite in the water?","00:16:45,300","00:16:52,000",True

"261","1","4","Mrs","Leonard, the Lord never gives us more than we can handle. Thankfully, He blessed me with two other children who are dumb as soup.","00:17:53,400","00:18:00,300",True
"262","1","4","Gablehouser","Now, that's impossible! You must have had him when you were a teenager.","00:18:48,200","00:18:51,400",True

"266","1","5","Leonard","No, orcs are magic. Superman is vulnerable to magic. Not to mention you already lost Godzilla to the Illinois cavalry and Hulk.","00:00:17,900","00:00:25,500",True
"267","1","5","Raj","Why don't you just have Robert E. Lee charge the line with Shiva and Ganesh?","00:00:26,100","00:00:30,000",True

"275","1","5","Lesley","Yep, come for the breasts, stay for the brains. Glad I ran into you. The Physics Department string quartet needs a new cellist.","00:02:08,900","00:02:16,200",False
"276","1","5","Leonard","Yeah, my parents felt that naming me Leonard and putting me in Advanced Placement classes wasn't getting me beaten up enough.","00:02:38,600","00:02:45,300",True

"281","1","5","Leonard","If Penny didn't know that Leslie had turned me down, then it would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought I should ask her, Leslie, out, indicating that she had no interest in me asking her, Penny, out. But, because she did know that I had asked Leslie out and that she, Leslie, had turned me down, then she, Penny, could be offering consolation.","00:03:54,000","00:04:11,200",True
"282","1","5","Leonard","""That's too bad, you would have made a cute couple,"" but while thinking: ""Good, Leonard remains available.""","00:04:13,200","00:04:19,700",True

"284","1","5","Sheldon","I said I could follow it. I didn't say I care.","00:04:34,000","00:04:36,600",True
"285","1","5","Lesley","If you're up for it, we could practice that middle section again.","00:05:32,700","00:05:35,700",False

"287","1","5","Lesley","That was before I saw you handling that beautiful piece of wood between your legs.","00:06:02,900","00:06:07,100",True
"288","1","5","Lesley","I thought I saw your pupils dilate when you looked at her. Which, unless you're a heroin addict, points to sexual attraction.","00:06:31,500","00:06:37,200",True
"289","1","5","Leonard","I did have a poppy seed bagel for breakfast. Which could cause a positive urine test for opiates, but certainly not dilate my pupils. So I guess there was no point in bringing it up.","00:06:38,700","00:06:48,300",True

"294","1","5","Penny","All right, look, a tie on the doorknob usually means someone doesn't want to be disturbed because, they're... you know, gettin' busy.","00:08:26,800","00:08:33,900",True
"295","1","5","Sheldon","So you're saying Leonard has a girl in there?","00:08:36,100","00:08:38,000",False
"296","1","5","Penny","Well, either that or he's lost his tie rack and gotten really into Bryan Adams.","00:08:38,200","00:08:42,700",True
"297","1","5","Sheldon","Yes, but there's usually planning, courtship, advance notice... Last time, I was able to book a cruise to the Arctic to see a solar eclipse.","00:08:59,500","00:09:08,300",True
"298","1","5","Penny","You had to leave the state because your roommate was having sex?","00:09:09,700","00:09:13,000",False

"312","1","5","Leonard","Regardless, I have a chance at a real relationship with Leslie. I'm not going to pass that up for some hypothetical future of happiness with a woman who may or may not want me to be happy, with a woman who is currently making me happy.","00:15:13,700","00:15:25,800",True

"316","1","5","Lesley","Listen, neither of us are neuroscientists, but we both understand the biochemistry of sex. I mean, dopamine in our brains is released across synapses, causing pleasure. You stick electrodes in a rat's brain, give him an orgasm button, he'll push that thing until he starves to death.","00:16:32,200","00:16:45,200",True
"317","1","5","Lesley","Well, the only difference between us and the rat is that you can't stick an electrode in our hypothalamus. That's where you come in.","00:16:48,300","00:16:54,300",True
"318","1","5","Lesley","I don't know about your sex drive, but I'm probably good till New Year's.","00:17:02,000","00:17:05,600",True

"334","1","7","Penny","There's this girl I know from back in Nebraska, Christy. She called me up, and she's like, ""Hey, how's California?"" And I'm like, ""Awesome,"" 'cause, you know, it's not Nebraska. And the next thing I know she's invited herself out here to stay with me.","00:01:19,500","00:01:30,700",False
"335","1","7","Penny","Anyway, she got here today and she's just been in my apartment yakity yakking about every guy she slept with in Omaha, which is basically every guy in Omaha, and washing the sluttiest collection of underwear you have ever seen in my bathroom sink.","00:01:34,500","00:01:45,900",False
"336","1","7","Howard","Is she doing it one thong at a time, or does she throw it all in... ...like some sort of erotic bouillabaisse?","00:01:46,000","00:01:52,000",True
"337","1","7","Leonard","So if you don't like this Christy, why are you letting her stay?","00:01:58,100","00:02:00,800",False
"338","1","7","Penny","She was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my brother, so she's kind of family.","00:02:00,900","00:02:05,300",True
"339","1","7","Leonard","The only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut Raj in half.","00:03:21,600","00:03:25,600",True
"340","1","7","Raj","Sure, cut the foreigner in half. There's a billion more where he came from.","00:03:25,900","00:03:30,000",True

"344","1","7","Sheldon","Okay, that's it. I don't know how, but she is cheating. No one can be that attractive and this skilled at a video game.","00:04:36,400","00:04:42,700",False
"345","1","7","Sheldon","You laugh now-- you just wait until you need tech support.","00:04:54,700","00:04:57,700",True

"353","1","7","Leonard","I'm sorry, are you suggesting that if we let Penny stay we might succumb to cannibalism?","00:06:47,200","00:06:51,400",True
"354","1","7","Leonard","If you promise not to chew the flesh off our bones while we sleep, you can stay.","00:06:56,300","00:07:00,600",True
"355","1","7","Penny","How am I supposed to plan my bodily functions?","00:07:28,500","00:07:30,500",False
"356","1","7","Sheldon","- Why? - It's culturally universal. A bed, even a temporary bed, is always oriented with the headboard away from the door. It serves the ancient imperative of protecting oneself against marauders.","00:07:46,300","00:07:57,300",True
"357","1","7","Sheldon","Yes, if you use my toothbrush, I'll jump out that window.","00:08:04,600","00:08:08,100",True

"360","1","7","Leonard","I know. You have a TV in your room. Why don't you just have breakfast in bed?","00:10:22,500","00:10:27,000",True
"361","1","7","Sheldon","Because I am neither an invalid, nor a woman celebrating Mother's Day.","00:10:27,200","00:10:30,700",True
"362","1","7","Sheldon","Okay, this cereal has lost all its molecular integrity. I now have a bowl of shredded wheat paste.","00:10:44,600","00:10:49,300",True
"363","1","7","Penny","Why do you people hate sleep? Are you wearing my robe?","00:10:56,600","00:11:01,200",True

"372","1","7","Howard","If you'll excuse me, I have some Bar Mitzvah bonds to cash.","00:13:39,500","00:13:43,600",True
"373","1","7","Sheldon","Let me walk you through it. Our standard order is: the steamed dumpling appetizer, General Tso's chicken, beef with broccoli, shrimp with lobster sauce and vegetable lo mein. Do you see the problem?","00:13:56,900","00:14:07,500",True

"376","1","7","Leonard","Can we get an order of dumplings but with three instead of four?","00:14:50,800","00:14:53,400",False
"377","1","7","Leonard","Fine. Bring us three orders of dumplings. - That's 12. We'll each have four. - That works.","00:15:01,200","00:15:06,100",False

"552","1","9","Sheldon","Oh, I see. It was the apple falling on Newton's head, - was that just an anecdote? - You are not Isaac Newton.","00:14:46,200","00:14:51,900",False
"553","1","9","Sheldon","No, no, that's true. Gravity would have been apparent to me without the apple.","00:14:52,000","00:14:55,300",True
"554","1","9","Leonard","Look, if you weren't happy with my presentation then maybe you should have given it with me!","00:15:00,900","00:15:04,700",False
"555","1","9","Sheldon","Oh, please. I admit that spherical chicken joke, - that was hilarious. - Thank you. But it was straight downhill from there.","00:15:14,700","00:15:20,100",True
"556","1","9","Leonard","I've had enough of your condescendship. Maybe I didn't go to college when I was 11 like you. Maybe I got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16 but you are not the only person who is smarter than everyone else in this room! No offense.","00:15:20,300","00:15:34,000",True

"561","1","9","Sheldon","I really don't understand what you're so unhappy about. You begged me to come, I came. There's just no pleasing you.","00:16:50,700","00:16:55,400",True
"562","1","9","Leonard","You're right, I'm the problem, I'm the one that needs help.","00:16:56,400","00:16:59,000",False

"567","1","10","Sheldon","I don't guess. As a scientist, I reach conclusions based on observation and experimentation. Although as I'm saying this, it occurs to me you may have been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot.","00:01:44,216","00:01:55,362",True

"573","1","10","Sheldon","I would suggest something to the effect of: singing is neither an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you, and if you disagree, I'd recommend you have a CAT scan to look for a tumor pressing on the cognitive processing centers of your brain.","00:05:02,243","00:05:14,025",False
"574","1","10","Leonard","I couldn't say that. I would have to say, ""You were terrific and I can't wait to hear you sing again.""","00:05:16,101","00:05:21,699",True
"575","1","10","Leonard","That's the social protocol. It's what you do when you have a friend who's proud of something they really suck at.","00:05:24,400","00:05:30,792",True
"576","1","10","Sheldon","When we played chess earlier, you were terrific, and I can't wait to play you again. Good night.","00:05:37,834","00:05:42,387",False

"586","1","10","Leonard","I don't get it. I already told her a lie. Why replace it with a different lie?","00:08:19,825","00:08:24,039",False
"587","1","10","Sheldon","First of all, your lie was laughably transparent, where mine is exquisitely convoluted. While you were sleeping, I was weaving an un-unravelable web.","00:08:24,471","00:08:33,758",True
"588","1","10","Sheldon","If she Googles ""Leopold Houston,"" she'll find a Facebook page, an online blog depicting his descent into drug use and a desperate yet hopeful listing on eHarmony.com.","00:08:37,569","00:08:46,221",True
"589","1","10","Leonard","Okay, why would I go to a drug intervention for your cousin?","00:08:48,115","00:08:51,706",False
"590","1","10","Sheldon","Because it's in Long Beach, and I don't drive.","00:08:52,036","00:08:54,638",True
"591","1","10","Sheldon","- Of course not. There's no cousin Leo. There's no intervention. Focus, Leonard.","00:08:56,615","00:09:01,786",False
"592","1","10","Sheldon","We just leave the house on Friday night and we return in the wee hours, emotionally wrung out, from the work of convincing Leo to go back into rehab.","00:09:04,508","00:09:11,755",False
"593","1","10","Sheldon","For a noble purpose-- to spare me the social embarrassment of having a drug-addled first cousin-- which I'm assuming is embarrassing, yes?","00:09:22,141","00:09:30,064",False
"594","1","10","Sheldon","That's the best part. You don't have to. I told Penny that you would be embarrassed if you knew that she found out that you had lied, so she's agreed to operate as if the original lie is still in force.","00:09:33,885","00:09:43,642",True
"595","1","10","Penny","I got to tell you, a lot of friends would let their friend go alone, but that's not who you are. You are the kind of guy who stands by a friend when... Wen he has a symposium to go to.","00:10:15,868","00:10:25,906",False
"596","1","10","Howard","Wait a minute. Farmanfarmian is speaking and you're bogarting the symposium?","00:10:54,989","00:10:58,402",False

"600","1","10","Sheldon","No, that's the least of our worries. I've been doing some research on addiction, both the biochemical and behavioral aspects-- and I think there's a problem with the current version of our lie.","00:13:17,119","00:13:26,725",False
"601","1","10","Leonard","What are you talking about? It's fine! She bought it; it's over.","00:13:26,886","00:13:29,854",True

"603","1","10","Sheldon","You didn't read the bio, did you? He's not just a middle child, he is the quintessential middle child-- from a broken home, to boot. Psychologically speaking, the attention he gets by rebelling, even to the point of self-destruction, is more emotionally valuable than the help he would get at rehab.","00:13:53,493","00:14:08,883",True
"604","1","10","Sheldon","Excuse me, we just went over this. As the quintessential middle child, your addiction is rooted in your unmet need for attention.","00:15:21,507","00:15:28,889",True

"607","1","10","Sheldon","I'm sorry. Leonard, this is Toby Loobenfeld. He's a research assistant in the particle physics lab, but he also minored in theater at MIT.","00:15:38,742","00:15:46,657",False
"608","1","10","Toby","It was more of a double major, actually. Theater and physics. You can guess which one my bourgeois parents pushed me toward.","00:15:47,341","00:15:53,789",False
"609","1","10","Sheldon","You see, while Leo would not have gone into rehab, it is completely plausible that we would have talked him into leaving the motel and coming home with us.","00:15:57,411","00:16:05,759",True
"610","1","10","Sheldon","No. We're going with middle child and a genetic predisposition to inadequate serotonin production.","00:16:15,901","00:16:22,026",False
"611","1","10","Sheldon","Unfortunately, we weren't able to convince him to go to rehab.","00:16:41,080","00:16:44,506",True

"613","1","10","Toby","Let me ask you something, Penny. Have you ever woken up in a fleabag motel, covered in your own vomit, next to a transsexual prostitute?","00:17:08,315","00:17:17,328",False
"614","1","10","Penny","It was okay, I guess. It wasn't a big turnout, but they both really seemed to like it.","00:17:32,947","00:17:37,126",True
"615","1","10","Leonard","As you can see, detoxing can get pretty ugly. Let's give them some privacy.","00:18:38,725","00:18:42,579",False
"616","1","10","Penny","I have a video of me singing last night. Do you want to see it?","00:18:46,369","00:18:49,131",True

"624","1","11","Sheldon","From the data at hand, you really can't draw that conclusion. All you can say with absolute certainty is that that joke is not funny here.","00:01:05,395","00:01:11,657",True
"625","1","11","Penny","- It was the worst trip. Everyone got sick over the weekend.","00:01:20,799","00:01:24,670",False
"626","1","11","Sheldon","I don't need you to guess. I need you to know. Now, when did the symptoms first appear?","00:01:32,225","00:01:37,118",False
"627","1","11","Leonard","Penny, you'll have to excuse Sheldon. He's a bit of a germaphobe.","00:02:04,527","00:02:07,418",False

"632","1","11","Sheldon","We have no idea what pathogen Typhoid she has introduced into our environment. For having never been to Nebraska, I'm fairly certain that I have no corn-husking antibodies.","00:03:30,972","00:03:40,197",True
"633","1","11","Sheldon","When I'm lying comatose in a hospital relying on inferior minds to cure me, these Jell-O cultures and my accompanying notes will give them a fighting chance.","00:03:45,940","00:03:54,118",True

"914","1","15","Sheldon","This has nothing to do with religion. This has to do with the fact that you're a tiny, tiny man who still lives with his mother.","00:13:17,433","00:13:23,901",False

"920","1","15","Sheldon","Now, I am not saying that I should be the sole decider of who you mate with. If you're not attracted to the suitor, the likelihood of conception will be reduced.","00:14:47,707","00:14:55,564",False
"921","1","15","Sheldon","I always thought I was more like a cuckoo bird. You know, a superior creature whose egg is placed in the nest of ordinary birds. Of course, the newly hatched cuckoo eats all the food, leaving the ordinary siblings to starve to death. Luckily for you, that's where the metaphor ended.","00:15:16,497","00:15:31,718",True
"923","1","15","Missy","You listen to me. If you want to start acting like a brother who cares about me, then terrific. Bring it on.

"941","1","16","Leonard","It's no big deal; it's just the way I was raised. My parents focused on celebrating achievements, and being expelled from a birth canal was not considered one of them.","00:01:26,708","00:01:34,764",True
"942","1","16","Sheldon","It's actually based on very sound theories. - His mother published a paper on it. - What was it called?","00:01:37,395","00:01:42,435",True
"943","1","16","Leonard","No, but it was okay. When I was little, I'd think maybe my parents would change their mind and surprise me with a party. Like this one birthday I came home from my cello lesson and I saw a lot of strange cars parked out front. When I got to the door, I could hear people whispering and I could smell German chocolate cake, which is my favorite.","00:02:15,548","00:02:31,988",False
"944","1","16","Leonard","Well, it was kind of like a birthday party. I got to see all my cousins, and there was cake, so...","00:02:39,822","00:02:46,072",True
