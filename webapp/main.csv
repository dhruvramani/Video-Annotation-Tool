"2","1","1","Sheldon","There's no point, I just think it's a good idea for a T-shirt.","00:00:14,400","00:00:17,600",True
"3","1","1","Receptionist","If you have to ask, maybe you shouldn't be here.","00:00:58,900","00:01:01,600",True
"4","1","1","Leonard","Sheldon, this was your idea. A little extra money to get fractional T-1 bandwidth in the apartment.","00:01:42,800","00:01:48,000",False
"5","1","1","Sheldon","I know, and I do yearn for faster downloads. But there's some poor woman who's gonna pin her hopes on my sperm. What if she winds up with a toddler who doesn't know if he should use an integral or a differential to solve the area under a curve?","00:01:48,100","00:02:01,700",True
"6","1","1","Leonard","I don't know... I've never reneged on a proffer of sperm before.","00:02:13,300","00:02:16,500",True
"7","1","1","Sheldon","You want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?","00:02:41,000","00:02:43,900",True
"8","1","1","Sheldon","No, it's true, I did a series of experiments when I was 12. My father broke his clavicle.","00:02:55,300","00:02:59,300",True
"9","1","1","Leonard","Is that why they sent you to boarding school?","00:03:00,700","00:03:02,600",False
"10","1","1","Sheldon","No. That was a result of my work with lasers.","00:03:02,700","00:03:05,400",True
"11","1","1","Leonard","We don't mean to interrupt. We live across the hall.","00:03:30,300","00:03:32,500",False
"12","1","1","Leonard","I think we should be good neighbors and invite her over, make her feel welcome.","00:04:21,900","00:04:25,800",False
"13","1","1","Sheldon","I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on MySpace.","00:04:33,800","00:04:38,900",True
"14","1","1","Penny","So, what do you guys do for fun around here?","00:05:50,600","00:05:53,000",False
"15","1","1","Penny","This looks like some serious stuff. - Leonard, did you do this? - Actually, that's my work.","00:06:34,300","00:06:39,300",True
"16","1","1","Sheldon","Yeah. Well, it's just some quantum mechanics with a little string theory doodling around the edges. That part there, that's just a joke. It's a spoof of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation.","00:06:41,200","00:06:50,700",True
"17","1","1","Penny","So you're like one of those Beautiful Mind genius guys.","00:06:52,100","00:06:55,400",False
"18","1","1","Sheldon","If by ""holy smokes"", you mean a derivative restatement of the kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men's room at MIT, sure.","00:07:06,100","00:07:12,700",True
"19","1","1","Leonard","At least I didn't have to invent 26 dimensions just to make the math come out.","00:07:19,100","00:07:23,000",True
"20","1","1","Sheldon","In the winter, that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm, and yet not so close as to cause perspiration In the summer, it's directly in the path of a cross-breeze created by opening windows there and there. It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, thus discouraging conversation, nor so far wide as to create a parallax distortion. I could go on, but I think I've made my point.","00:07:46,000","00:08:06,100",True
"21","1","1","Sheldon","That's not true. Koothrappali and Wolowitz come over all the time.","00:08:44,100","00:08:46,800",False
"22","1","1","Leonard","Yeah. It's like regular Boggle, but... in Klingon.","00:09:00,400","00:09:04,000",True
"23","1","1","Leonard","That's probably enough about us. So, tell us about you.","00:09:07,400","00:09:10,300",False
"24","1","1","Leonard","I think what Sheldon's trying to say is that Sagittarius wouldn't have been our first guess.","00:09:31,000","00:09:35,900",False
"25","1","1","Penny","Yeah, a lot of people think I'm a water sign. Okay, let's see, what else. I'm a vegetarian. Except for fish. And the occasional steak. I love steak!","00:09:36,400","00:09:45,500",True
"26","1","1","Leonard","Well... do you have some sort of a job?","00:09:55,600","00:09:57,900",True
"27","1","1","Sheldon","It took you 4 years to get through high school?","00:10:57,900","00:11:00,000",True
"28","1","1","Leonard","Should I say something? I feel like I should say something.","00:11:10,400","00:11:13,000",False
"29","1","1","Leonard","No, it's not crazy. It's a... It's a paradox. Paradoxes are part of nature. Think about light. If you look at Huygens, light is a wave, as confirmed by the double-slit experiments, but then along comes Albert Einstein and discovers that light behaves like particles, too.","00:11:28,100","00:11:47,100",False
"31","1","1","Penny","I'm so sorry. I'm such a mess. On top of everything else, I'm all gross from moving and my stupid shower doesn't even work.","00:11:53,700","00:12:00,000",True
"32","1","1","Penny","Really? Would it be totally weird if I used it?","00:12:03,000","00:12:05,000",False
"33","1","1","Sheldon","It has been some time since we've had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment.","00:12:27,000","00:12:31,000",True
"34","1","1","Leonard","That's not true. Remember at Thanksgiving, my grandmother with Alzheimer's had that episode?","00:12:31,800","00:12:36,200",False
"35","1","1","Sheldon","Point taken. It has been some time since we've had a woman take her clothes off, after which we didn't want to rip our eyes out.","00:12:38,300","00:12:44,400",True
"36","1","1","Leonard","The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.","00:12:45,800","00:12:48,700",True
"37","1","1","Sheldon","So what exactly are you trying to accomplish here?","00:12:49,700","00:12:52,600",False
"38","1","1","Leonard","I'm not trying to have sex with her.","00:12:57,100","00:12:59,400",False
"39","1","1","Leonard","What makes you think she wouldn't have sex with me? I'm a male and she's a female.","00:13:02,800","00:13:07,100",False
"40","1","1","Leonard","I'm not going to engage in hypotheticals here. I'm just trying to be a good neighbor.","00:13:10,800","00:13:15,000",False
"41","1","1","Sheldon","Do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered when she discovers your Luke Skywalker no-more-tears shampoo?","00:13:26,800","00:13:32,600",True
"42","1","1","Howard","It's a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.","00:13:46,900","00:13:51,000",False
"43","1","1","Leonard","And she's not a lady. She's just a new neighbor.","00:14:10,100","00:14:12,600",False
"44","1","1","Howard","And you want us out because you're anticipating coitus?","00:14:16,500","00:14:19,600",True
"45","1","1","Howard","It's French for ""good shower. "" It's a sentiment I can express in six languages.","00:15:01,100","00:15:05,700",True
"46","1","1","Leonard","Sure, you can ask me a favor. I would do you a favor for you.","00:15:31,800","00:15:34,900",True
"47","1","1","Penny","It's just not the kind of thing you ask a guy you just met.","00:15:40,200","00:15:43,500",False
"48","1","1","Sheldon","I really think we should examine the chain of causality here.","00:15:53,800","00:15:56,800",False
"49","1","1","Sheldon","A beautiful woman stands naked in our shower. Event B... we drive halfway across town to retrieve a television set from the aforementioned woman's ex-boyfriend. Query... on what plane of existence is there even a semi-rational link between these events?","00:15:58,400","00:16:11,700",False
"50","1","1","Leonard","She asked me to do her a favor, Sheldon.","00:16:12,900","00:16:15,200",False
"51","1","1","Sheldon","Yes, well, that may be the proximal cause of our journey, but we both know it only exists in contradistinction to the higher level distal cause.","00:16:15,500","00:16:22,500",False
"52","1","1","Leonard","That's a biological impossibility. And you didn't have to come.","00:16:26,200","00:16:29,700",True
"53","1","1","Leonard","Come on, you know how it is with breakups.","00:16:37,400","00:16:39,300",False
"54","1","1","Sheldon","You did not break up with Joyce Kim. She defected to North Korea.","00:16:44,300","00:16:47,500",True
"55","1","1","Sheldon","Leonard, the two of us can't even carry a TV.","00:17:08,800","00:17:11,400",True
"56","1","1","Penny","So, you guys work with Leonard and Sheldon at the university?","00:17:13,600","00:17:16,500",False
"57","1","1","Howard","He speaks English. He just can't speak to women.","00:17:25,100","00:17:27,800",True
"58","1","1","Leonard","We're not going to give up just like that.","00:17:54,200","00:17:56,100",False
"59","1","1","Leonard","Excuse me. If I were to give up on the first little hitch, I never would have identified the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the Big Bang.","00:18:00,800","00:18:08,300",True
"60","1","1","Sheldon","It's just a privilege to watch your mind at work.","00:18:25,900","00:18:28,500",True
"61","1","1","Leonard","Come on, we have a combined IQ of 360. We should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building.","00:18:29,700","00:18:35,400",False
"62","1","1","Man","How the hell did you get in the building?","00:19:05,100","00:19:06,800",False
"63","1","1","Leonard","Sheldon, I am so sorry I dragged you through this.","00:19:36,600","00:19:39,400",False
"64","1","1","Sheldon","It's okay. It wasn't my first pantsing and it won't be my last.","00:19:39,600","00:19:43,300",True
"65","1","1","Leonard","Anyway, I've learned my lesson. She's out of my league, I'm done with her. Got my work, one day I'll win the Nobel Prize and then I'll die alone.","00:19:56,500","00:20:04,500",False
"66","1","1","Sheldon","Don't think like that. You're not going to die alone.","00:20:04,700","00:20:07,600",False
"67","1","1","Sheldon","And you're certainly not going to win a Nobel Prize.","00:20:12,000","00:20:14,900",True
"68","1","1","Howard","This is one of my favorite places to kick back after a quest. They have a great house ale.","00:20:15,500","00:20:20,800",True
"69","1","1","Howard","Yeah, I've had him since level ten. His name is Buttons. Anyway, if you had your own game character we could hang out, maybe go on a quest.","00:20:22,700","00:20:32,800",False
"70","1","1","Penny","I don't think I'll be able to stop thinking about it.","00:20:37,300","00:20:39,800",True
"71","1","1","Leonard","Well, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards and I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory.","00:20:48,500","00:20:53,500",True
"72","1","1","Penny","I'm so sorry. I really thought if you guys went instead of me he wouldn't be such an ass.","00:20:54,200","00:20:58,800",False
"73","1","1","Sheldon","That was a valid...? What is happening to you?","00:21:01,100","00:21:03,700",True
"74","1","1","Penny","Really, thank you so much for going and trying, you're just... You're so terrific. Really. Why don't you put some clothes on, I'll get my purse, and dinner is on me, okay?","00:21:04,900","00:21:17,000",False
"76","1","1","Sheldon","We can't have Thai food, - we had Indian for lunch. - So?","00:21:46,000","00:21:48,800",False
"78","1","1","Howard","Turn left on Lake Street and head up to Colorado. I know a wonderful little sushi bar that has karaoke.","00:22:01,700","00:22:06,700",False
"79","1","1","Sheldon","I don't know what your odds are in the world as a whole, but as far as the population of this car goes, you're a veritable mack daddy.","00:22:21,500","00:22:27,700",True
"80","1","2","Sheldon","Since it's not bee season, you can have my epinephrine.","00:00:09,700","00:00:12,300",True
"81","1","2","Sheldon","Thailand has had the fork since the latter half of the 19th Century. Interestingly  they don't put the fork in their mouth-- they use it to put the food on a spoon which then goes into their mouth.","00:00:17,600","00:00:25,900",True
"83","1","2","Leonard","So, you're coming home from work. That's great. How was work?","00:00:48,200","00:00:50,800",False
"84","1","2","Howard","- Haven't you ever been told how beautiful you are in flawless Russian?","00:01:22,500","00:01:26,200",True
"85","1","2","Sheldon","Don't take it personally, it's his pathology. He can't talk to women.","00:01:39,300","00:01:42,600",False
"86","1","2","Leonard","If you don't have any other plans, do you want to join us for Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?","00:02:04,100","00:02:08,900",False
"87","1","2","Penny","A marathon? How many Superman movies are there?","00:02:09,300","00:02:11,900",False
"88","1","2","Penny","I do like the one where Lois Lane falls from the helicopter and Superman swooshes down and catches her. Which one was that?","00:02:15,400","00:02:20,600",True
"90","1","2","Sheldon","Lois Lane is falling, accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second per second. Superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Miss Lane, who is now traveling at approximately 120 miles an hour, hits them and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces.","00:02:31,600","00:02:45,200",True
"91","1","2","Sheldon","In what space, sir? She's two feet above the ground. Frankly, if he really loved her, he'd let her hit the pavement. It'd be a more merciful death.","00:02:51,400","00:02:59,400",True
"92","1","2","Leonard","Excuse me, your entire argument is predicated on the assumption that Superman's flight is a feat of strength.","00:03:00,300","00:03:06,600",True
"93","1","2","Sheldon","Are you listening  to yourself? It is well established that his flight is a feat of strength. It is an extension of his ability to leap tall buildings, an ability he derives from exposure to Earth's yellow sun.","00:03:06,800","00:03:15,600",True
"94","1","2","Sheldon","A combination of the moon's solar reflection and the energy-storage capacity of Kryptonian skin cells.","00:03:17,800","00:03:22,600",True
"95","1","2","Leonard","Her apartment's on the fourth floor but the elevator's broken, so... You're just gonna be done? Okay. Cool. Thanks","00:04:14,200","00:04:19,500",False
"97","1","2","Leonard","We don't need strength-- we're physicists. We are the intellectual descendants of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever and I can move the Earth. It's just a matter of... I don't have this.","00:04:33,500","00:04:42,700",True
"98","1","2","Sheldon","Yes, but they all involve a green lantern and a power ring.","00:04:55,200","00:04:57,900",True
"99","1","2","Sheldon","You do understand that our efforts here will in no way increase the odds of you having sexual congress with this woman.","00:05:52,600","00:05:58,200",True
"100","1","2","Leonard","I'm doing this to be a good neighbor. In any case, there's no way it could lower the odds.","00:06:06,000","00:06:11,300",True
"104","1","2","Sheldon","The Mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy. This is chaos. Excuse me. Explain to me an organizational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid.","00:06:39,700","00:06:49,900",True
"105","1","2","Sheldon","I'm just inferring this is a couch because the evidence suggests the coffee table is having a tiny garage sale.","00:06:51,200","00:06:56,300",True
"106","1","2","Leonard","Did it ever occur to you that not everyone has the compulsive need to sort, organize and label the entire world around them?","00:06:58,000","00:07:03,900",False
"107","1","2","Sheldon","Excuse me, but I think we've both found that helpful at times.","00:07:15,500","00:07:18,100",True
"108","1","2","Sheldon","This is not your home. This is not anyone's home. This is a swirling vortex of entropy.","00:07:28,400","00:07:33,600",False
"109","1","2","Leonard","When the transvestite lived here, you didn't care how he kept the place.","00:07:35,600","00:07:38,900",False
"110","1","2","Penny","Great. Was it hard getting it up the stairs?","00:07:57,000","00:07:59,000",True
"111","1","2","Sheldon","I had no choice. I couldn't sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom was our living room, and just outside our living room was that hallway, and immediately adjacent to the hallway was... this.","00:09:31,300","00:09:41,100",True
"112","1","2","Leonard","Do you realize that if Penny wakes up, there is no reasonable explanation as to why we're here.","00:09:43,400","00:09:48,100",False
"113","1","2","Leonard","No, no, you gave me an explanation. Its reasonableness will be determined by a jury of your peers.","00:09:51,900","00:09:57,500",True
"114","1","2","Sheldon","You might want to speak in a lower register.","00:10:06,400","00:10:09,000",False
"115","1","2","Leonard","I accept your premise. Now, please, let's go.","00:10:36,900","00:10:39,600",False
"116","1","2","Sheldon","If you have time to lean, you have time to clean.","00:10:46,500","00:10:49,300",True
"117","1","2","Sheldon","I have to say I slept splendidly. Granted, not long, but just deeply and well.","00:11:04,300","00:11:10,300",True
"118","1","2","Sheldon","Granted, my methods may have been somewhat unorthodox, but I think the end result will be a measurable enhancement - to Penny's quality of life - You've convinced me.","00:11:21,800","00:11:29,700",False
"119","1","2","Penny","You came into my apartment last night while I was sleeping?!","00:12:19,400","00:12:21,800",False
"120","1","2","Sheldon","Really more to organize. You're not actually dirty, per se.","00:12:23,400","00:12:26,000",True
"121","1","2","Leonard","Oh, yes, we discussed it at length last night.","00:12:33,500","00:12:35,600",True
"122","1","2","Penny","And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?","00:12:51,000","00:12:53,900",False
"123","1","2","Sheldon","Boy, you are all over the place this morning.","00:14:02,700","00:14:05,300",True
"124","1","2","Sheldon","I have a master's and two Ph.D.s, I should not have to do this.","00:14:09,400","00:14:12,100",True
"125","1","2","Sheldon","I am truly sorry for what happened last night. I take full responsibility. And I hope that it won't color your opinion of Leonard, who is not only a wonderful guy, but also, I hear, a gentle and thorough lover.","00:14:15,100","00:14:27,600",True
"127","1","2","Penny","That's exactly what I thought. Thank you for listening. You're a doll.","00:16:02,500","00:16:06,300",False
"128","1","2","Raj","Actually, I was less the chatter than the chat-ee.","00:16:51,500","00:16:54,000",True
"129","1","2","Leonard","What did she say? Is she still mad at me?","00:16:54,900","00:16:56,900",False
"130","1","2","Raj","Well, she was upset at first, but probably because her sister shot somebody.","00:16:57,100","00:17:01,200",True
"131","1","2","Raj","But then there was something about you, and then she hugged me.","00:17:03,600","00:17:06,900",True
"133","1","2","Penny","You guys, seriously, I grew up on a farm, okay? I rebuilt a tractor engine when I was, like, 12. I think I can put together a cheap, Swedish media center.","00:18:53,800","00:19:00,500",False
"134","1","2","Leonard","No, please. We insist. It's the least we can do, considering.","00:19:00,600","00:19:03,600",False
"135","1","2","Howard","These instructions are a pictographic representation of the least imaginative way to assemble these components. This, right here is why Sweden has no space program.","00:19:10,900","00:19:19,100",True
"136","1","2","Penny","Well, it looked pretty good in the store.","00:19:20,700","00:19:22,400",False
"137","1","2","Leonard","It is an inefficient design. For example, she has a flat screen TV, which means all the space behind it is wasted.","00:19:22,700","00:19:27,700",False
"139","1","2","Howard","The PVC comes down here. Maybe a little corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here.","00:19:55,300","00:19:58,900",False
"140","1","2","Penny","It's hot in here. I think I'll just take off all my clothes.","00:20:05,800","00:20:08,300",True
"141","1","3","Leonard","Don't panic. This is what the last 97 hours have been about.","00:00:18,830","00:00:21,783",True
"142","1","3","Howard","Stay frosty. There's a horde of armed goblins on the other side of that gate guarding the Sword of Asaroth.","00:00:22,183","00:00:27,595",True
"143","1","3","Leonard","Warriors, unsheathe your weapons. Magic wielders, raise your wands.","00:00:27,942","00:00:30,961",False
"145","1","3","Howard","Sheldon, he's got Raj. Use your sleep spell!","00:01:02,560","00:01:04,592",False
"146","1","3","Sheldon","There is no more Sheldon. I am the sword master!","00:01:12,750","00:01:16,203",True
"147","1","3","Leonard","No. I can't look at you or your avatar right now.","00:02:12,400","00:02:15,400",True
"148","1","3","Sheldon","Don't forget the mail you took accidentally on purpose as an excuse to talk to her.","00:02:24,700","00:02:28,400",True
"149","1","3","Howard","Stealing snail mail-- very old school. I like it.","00:02:31,100","00:02:33,700",True
"150","1","3","Penny","Thank you. I've got to talk to that mailman.","00:02:56,100","00:02:58,100",False
"151","1","3","Howard","Kissing, what kind of kissing? Cheeks? Lips? Chaste? French?","00:03:32,700","00:03:35,700",True
"152","1","3","Sheldon","Don't tell me that your hopeless infatuation is devolving into pointless jealousy.","00:03:44,600","00:03:48,300",False
"153","1","3","Leonard","I'm done with Penny. I'm going to be more realistic and go after someone my own speed.","00:04:25,600","00:04:30,200",False
"154","1","3","Sheldon","The dietician at the cafeteria with the limp and the lazy eye?","00:04:34,000","00:04:37,200",True
"155","1","3","Howard","I don't know. You guys work in the same lab.","00:04:52,100","00:04:53,900",False
"156","1","3","Leonard","I've done it. About two seconds. 2.6 for minestrone.","00:05:37,400","00:05:40,100",True
"157","1","3","Leonard","Anyway, I was thinking more of a bio-social exploration with a neuro-chemical overlay.","00:05:46,900","00:05:51,900",False
"158","1","3","Leonard","I was going to characterize it as the modification of our colleague-slash-friendship paradigm with the addition of a date-like component, but we don't need to quibble over terminology.","00:05:57,200","00:06:06,900",True
"159","1","3","Lesley","Interesting. And would you agree that the primary way we would evaluate either the success or failure of the date would be based on the biochemical reaction during the good night kiss?","00:06:21,700","00:06:30,300",False
"160","1","3","Lesley","Why don't we just stipulate that the date goes well and move to the key variable?","00:06:33,400","00:06:37,000",False
"161","1","3","Leonard","- You proposed the experiment. I think you should present your findings first.","00:07:02,700","00:07:07,000",True
"162","1","3","Howard","Sheldon, if you were a robot, and I knew and you didn't...","00:07:37,900","00:07:42,900",True
"164","1","3","Howard","Maybe-- although the history of science fiction is not on your side.","00:07:57,600","00:08:01,100",True
"165","1","3","Sheldon","Okay, let me ask you this-- when I learn that I'm a robot, would I be bound by Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics?","00:08:02,200","00:08:09,800",True
"166","1","3","Howard","That's true. Have you ever harmed a human being or through inaction allowed a human being to come to harm?","00:08:17,800","00:08:22,300",False
"167","1","3","Howard","- Have you ever harmed yourself or allowed yourself to be harmed except in cases where a human being would have been endangered?","00:08:22,500","00:08:28,600",False
"168","1","3","Leonard","Oh, we tried kissing, but the Earth didn't move.","00:08:47,800","00:08:50,600",True
"169","1","3","Leonard","I mean, any more than the 383 miles that it was going to move anyway.","00:08:52,100","00:08:55,800",True
"170","1","3","Sheldon","Oh, I've seen that look before. This is just going to be two weeks of moping and tedious emo songs and calling me to come down to pet stores to look at cats.","00:08:58,300","00:09:07,100",True
"171","1","3","Sheldon","I don't know if I can take it.","00:09:09,500","00:09:11,000",False

"174","1","3","Howard","I think Mrs. Tishman's got her eye on you. I've been there. You're in for a treat.","00:09:51,800","00:09:57,100",False
"175","1","3","Sheldon","If you're compiling a mix CD for a double suicide. Oh, I hope that scratching post is for you.","00:10:29,000","00:10:35,600",True
"176","1","3","Leonard","I know what you're thinking. I've taken your asthma into account. There's a feline geneticist in San Diego who's developed the cutest little hypoallergenic calicos.","00:10:36,800","00:10:44,700",True
"177","1","3","Sheldon","Do you really think you can satisfy your need for a relationship with a genetically altered cat?","00:10:52,200","00:10:56,400",False
"178","1","3","Sheldon","No, no, that was not my point. My point was don't buy a cat.","00:11:45,600","00:11:50,400",True
"180","1","3","Leonard","I was wondering if you had plans for dinner.","00:12:12,000","00:12:13,900",False
"181","1","3","Leonard","There is an inherent ambiguity in the word ""dinner."" Technically it refers to the largest meal of the day whenever it's consumed. So to clarify here, by dinner I mean supper.","00:12:16,800","00:12:25,100",False
"182","1","3","Sheldon","No. The dark crescent-shaped patterns under your arms conceal it nicely.","00:13:49,100","00:13:53,400",True
"183","1","3","Sheldon","- What time is your date? - 6:30.","00:13:55,800","00:13:57,700",False
"184","1","3","Sheldon","No, well, now there's always the possibility that alcohol and poor judgment on her part might lead to a nice romantic evening.","00:14:24,000","00:14:31,200",True
"185","1","3","Leonard","You're right. Alcohol, poor judgment-- it could go well.","00:14:32,900","00:14:35,900",True
"186","1","3","Leonard","You could've stopped at ""it could go well.""","00:14:46,700","00:14:49,100",False
"187","1","3","Leonard","I mean, I'm a perfectly nice guy. There's no reason we couldn't go and have a lovely dinner, maybe take a walk afterwards, talk about things we have in common. You love pottery? I love pottery! There's a pause, we both know what's happening. I lean in, we kiss. It's a little tentative at first, but then I realize she's kissing me back. She's biting my lower lip! She wants me! This thing is going the distance! We're going to have sex! Oh, God, oh, my God!","00:14:52,600","00:15:19,000",False
"188","1","3","Sheldon","- What?! - It's a biofeedback technique. It's relaxation through brain wave manipulation. I read a paper about it in Journal of American Neuroscience. It was a little sparsely sourced, but I think the basic science is valid. I probably have it here somewhere.","00:15:43,500","00:15:55,600",True
"189","1","3","Leonard","Who am I kidding? I can't go through with this. You need to call her and cancel.","00:15:56,500","00:16:00,000",True
"191","1","3","Sheldon","I'll just tell her that you had a routine colonoscopy and haven't quite bounced back.","00:16:19,400","00:16:23,200",True
"192","1","3","Leonard","I can't, because if I don't show up she'll still be expecting you.","00:16:26,600","00:16:29,300",False
"193","1","3","Leonard","Stop asking me all these questions. I need to take another shower.","00:16:33,100","00:16:36,800",False
"194","1","3","Penny","So are the rest of the guys meeting us here?","00:16:40,200","00:16:42,000",False
"195","1","3","Leonard","We both have people in our lives who... want to nip intestinal polyps in the bud.","00:17:02,600","00:17:08,500",True
"196","1","3","Leonard","Well, with the exception of string theory, not much has happened since the 1930s. And you can't prove string theory. At best you can say, ""Hey, look, my idea has an internal logical consistency.""","00:17:22,300","00:17:34,700",True
"197","1","3","Penny","Doug? Oh, yeah, I don't know. I mean, you know, he's nice and funny, but...","00:18:04,300","00:18:08,900",False
"198","1","3","Leonard","Just say the ""but"" thing about Doug and then I'll get her back.","00:18:14,600","00:18:17,900",False
"199","1","3","Penny","No, it's usually over a weekend, and trust me, you do not feel good after it.","00:18:54,500","00:18:58,600",False
"201","1","3","Penny","You sure you don't want to go to the emergency room? No, I'm okay. It stopped bleeding.","00:20:01,500","00:20:05,800",True
"202","1","3","Penny","I know, but you did throw up. Isn't that a sign of a concussion?","00:20:06,300","00:20:09,400",False
"205","1","3","Leonard","When I take a girl on a date-- and I do-- she knows she's been dated.","00:20:56,200","00:21:03,500",True
"208","1","3","Leonard","I think I might have a little concussion. I'm gonna go lie down for a while. Good night.","00:21:13,300","00:21:17,600",True
"209","1","4","Sheldon","It's time travel, I will have already done that.","00:00:28,600","00:00:30,600",True

"212","1","4","Leonard","Then we'll avoid him, we'll meet the new department head, congratulate him, shake his hand and go.","00:00:55,500","00:00:59,700",False
"213","1","4","Sheldon","How's this? ""Pleased to meet you, Dr. Gablehauser. ""How fortunate for you that the university's ""chosen to hire you, despite the fact ""that you've done no original research in 25 years, ""and instead have written a series of popular books ""that reduce the great concepts of science ""to a series of anecdotes, ""each one dumbed down to accommodate the duration ""of an average bowel movement.","00:00:59,900","00:01:18,600",True
"214","1","4","Leonard","Well, you did call him a glorified high school science teacher whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts.","00:02:35,900","00:02:41,800",True
"215","1","4","Sheldon","I finally have time to test my hypothesis about the separation of the water molecules from the egg proteins and its impact vis-a-vis taste.","00:03:25,600","00:03:32,700",True
"216","1","4","Leonard","You know, I'm sure if you just apologize to Gablehauser, he would give you your job back.","00:03:41,900","00:03:46,000",False
"217","1","4","Sheldon","I don't want my job back. I've spent the past three and a half years staring at grease boards full of equations. Before that, I spent four years working on my thesis. Before that, I was in college, and before that, I was in the fifth grade. This is my first day off in decades and I'm going to savor it.","00:03:46,200","00:04:03,000",False

"222","1","4","Penny","Maybe it's all for the best. I always say when one door closes, another one opens.","00:05:36,900","00:05:41,000",True
"223","1","4","Sheldon","Or if the first door closing creates a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door.","00:05:49,000","00:05:53,000",True
"224","1","4","Sheldon","You're not leaving yourself enough space between cars.","00:06:01,000","00:06:03,200",False
"225","1","4","Sheldon","- No, let me do the math for you. This car weighs, let's say 4,000 pounds. Now add 140 for me, 120 for you...","00:06:03,400","00:06:10,800",True
"227","1","4","Sheldon","You want to hear an interesting thing about tomatoes?","00:07:06,600","00:07:08,800",False
"228","1","4","Sheldon","Yes, but anyone who knows anything about the dynamics of bacterial growth knows to pick up their refrigerated food on the way out of the supermarket.","00:07:13,500","00:07:19,800",True
"229","1","4","Sheldon","Well, there's some value to taking a multivitamin, but the human body can only absorb so much. What you're buying here are the ingredients for very expensive urine.","00:07:46,000","00:07:55,000",True
"230","1","4","Sheldon","Think about it. It's a product that doesn't spoil and you're going to be needing them for at least the next 30 years.","00:08:30,300","00:08:35,800",True
"231","1","4","Penny","You want me to buy 30 years worth of tampons?","00:08:36,500","00:08:39,100",True
"232","1","4","Leonard","Hey, I just ran into Penny. She seemed upset about something.","00:09:12,000","00:09:14,700",False
"233","1","4","Sheldon","I think it's her time of the month.","00:09:15,100","00:09:17,200",True
"235","1","4","Sheldon","Oh, that was a dead end. Scrambled eggs are as good as they're ever going to be.","00:09:32,800","00:09:37,100",True
"236","1","4","Sheldon","I read an article about Japanese scientists who inserted DNA from luminous jellyfish into other animals, and I thought, ""Hey, fish nightlights.""","00:09:41,500","00:09:49,600",True
"237","1","4","Leonard","- I didn't know what else to do. He's lost all focus. Every day he's got a new obsession.","00:10:34,400","00:10:40,400",True
"239","1","4","Sheldon","I was working with luminous fish, and I thought...","00:11:13,500","00:11:16,200",False
"242","1","4","Leonard","Because one of the great minds of the 21st century is raising glow-in-the-dark fish and weaving serapes.","00:11:28,400","00:11:34,100",True
"243","1","4","Leonard","Really? When was the last time you left the house?","00:11:45,500","00:11:47,700",False
"244","1","4","Sheldon","Well, then buckle up. In the next four to eight days she's going to get very crabby.","00:11:52,100","00:11:56,500",True
"245","1","4","Sheldon","Yes, well, I'm not a child-- I'm a grown man, capable of living my life as I see fit. And I certainly don't need someone telling on me to my mother!","00:12:02,100","00:12:09,700",True

"248","1","4","Mrs","- Well, poor boy had a fit. Locked himself in his room and built a sonic death ray.","00:14:20,600","00:14:26,000",True
"249","1","4","Mrs","That's what he called it. Didn't even slow down the neighbor kids.","00:14:28,500","00:14:31,600",True
"250","1","4","Mrs","It pissed our dog off to no end.","00:14:33,200","00:14:35,100",True

"253","1","4","Leonard","This is ridiculous. Damn it, Sheldon, snap out of it! You're a physicist-- You belong at the university doing research, not hiding in your room!","00:15:59,800","00:16:07,200",False
"254","1","4","Mrs","Well, that looks awful fancy. What is that?","00:16:27,600","00:16:30,000",False
"255","1","4","Mrs","You know how your daddy used to say that you can only fish for so long before you got to throw a stick of dynamite in the water?","00:16:45,300","00:16:52,000",True

"261","1","4","Mrs","Leonard, the Lord never gives us more than we can handle. Thankfully, He blessed me with two other children who are dumb as soup.","00:17:53,400","00:18:00,300",True
"262","1","4","Gablehouser","Now, that's impossible! You must have had him when you were a teenager.","00:18:48,200","00:18:51,400",True

"266","1","5","Leonard","No, orcs are magic. Superman is vulnerable to magic. Not to mention you already lost Godzilla to the Illinois cavalry and Hulk.","00:00:17,900","00:00:25,500",True
"267","1","5","Raj","Why don't you just have Robert E. Lee charge the line with Shiva and Ganesh?","00:00:26,100","00:00:30,000",True

"275","1","5","Lesley","Yep, come for the breasts, stay for the brains. Glad I ran into you. The Physics Department string quartet needs a new cellist.","00:02:08,900","00:02:16,200",False
"276","1","5","Leonard","Yeah, my parents felt that naming me Leonard and putting me in Advanced Placement classes wasn't getting me beaten up enough.","00:02:38,600","00:02:45,300",True

"281","1","5","Leonard","If Penny didn't know that Leslie had turned me down, then it would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought I should ask her, Leslie, out, indicating that she had no interest in me asking her, Penny, out. But, because she did know that I had asked Leslie out and that she, Leslie, had turned me down, then she, Penny, could be offering consolation.","00:03:54,000","00:04:11,200",True
"282","1","5","Leonard","""That's too bad, you would have made a cute couple,"" but while thinking: ""Good, Leonard remains available.""","00:04:13,200","00:04:19,700",True

"284","1","5","Sheldon","I said I could follow it. I didn't say I care.","00:04:34,000","00:04:36,600",True
"285","1","5","Lesley","If you're up for it, we could practice that middle section again.","00:05:32,700","00:05:35,700",False

"287","1","5","Lesley","That was before I saw you handling that beautiful piece of wood between your legs.","00:06:02,900","00:06:07,100",True
"288","1","5","Lesley","I thought I saw your pupils dilate when you looked at her. Which, unless you're a heroin addict, points to sexual attraction.","00:06:31,500","00:06:37,200",True
"289","1","5","Leonard","I did have a poppy seed bagel for breakfast. Which could cause a positive urine test for opiates, but certainly not dilate my pupils. So I guess there was no point in bringing it up.","00:06:38,700","00:06:48,300",True

"294","1","5","Penny","All right, look, a tie on the doorknob usually means someone doesn't want to be disturbed because, they're... you know, gettin' busy.","00:08:26,800","00:08:33,900",True
"295","1","5","Sheldon","So you're saying Leonard has a girl in there?","00:08:36,100","00:08:38,000",False
"296","1","5","Penny","Well, either that or he's lost his tie rack and gotten really into Bryan Adams.","00:08:38,200","00:08:42,700",True
"297","1","5","Sheldon","Yes, but there's usually planning, courtship, advance notice... Last time, I was able to book a cruise to the Arctic to see a solar eclipse.","00:08:59,500","00:09:08,300",True
"298","1","5","Penny","You had to leave the state because your roommate was having sex?","00:09:09,700","00:09:13,000",False

"312","1","5","Leonard","Regardless, I have a chance at a real relationship with Leslie. I'm not going to pass that up for some hypothetical future of happiness with a woman who may or may not want me to be happy, with a woman who is currently making me happy.","00:15:13,700","00:15:25,800",True

"316","1","5","Lesley","Listen, neither of us are neuroscientists, but we both understand the biochemistry of sex. I mean, dopamine in our brains is released across synapses, causing pleasure. You stick electrodes in a rat's brain, give him an orgasm button, he'll push that thing until he starves to death.","00:16:32,200","00:16:45,200",True
"317","1","5","Lesley","Well, the only difference between us and the rat is that you can't stick an electrode in our hypothalamus. That's where you come in.","00:16:48,300","00:16:54,300",True
"318","1","5","Lesley","I don't know about your sex drive, but I'm probably good till New Year's.","00:17:02,000","00:17:05,600",True

"334","1","7","Penny","There's this girl I know from back in Nebraska, Christy. She called me up, and she's like, ""Hey, how's California?"" And I'm like, ""Awesome,"" 'cause, you know, it's not Nebraska. And the next thing I know she's invited herself out here to stay with me.","00:01:19,500","00:01:30,700",False
"335","1","7","Penny","Anyway, she got here today and she's just been in my apartment yakity yakking about every guy she slept with in Omaha, which is basically every guy in Omaha, and washing the sluttiest collection of underwear you have ever seen in my bathroom sink.","00:01:34,500","00:01:45,900",False
"336","1","7","Howard","Is she doing it one thong at a time, or does she throw it all in... ...like some sort of erotic bouillabaisse?","00:01:46,000","00:01:52,000",True
"337","1","7","Leonard","So if you don't like this Christy, why are you letting her stay?","00:01:58,100","00:02:00,800",False
"338","1","7","Penny","She was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my brother, so she's kind of family.","00:02:00,900","00:02:05,300",True
"339","1","7","Leonard","The only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut Raj in half.","00:03:21,600","00:03:25,600",True
"340","1","7","Raj","Sure, cut the foreigner in half. There's a billion more where he came from.","00:03:25,900","00:03:30,000",True

"344","1","7","Sheldon","Okay, that's it. I don't know how, but she is cheating. No one can be that attractive and this skilled at a video game.","00:04:36,400","00:04:42,700",False
"345","1","7","Sheldon","You laugh now-- you just wait until you need tech support.","00:04:54,700","00:04:57,700",True

"353","1","7","Leonard","I'm sorry, are you suggesting that if we let Penny stay we might succumb to cannibalism?","00:06:47,200","00:06:51,400",True
"354","1","7","Leonard","If you promise not to chew the flesh off our bones while we sleep, you can stay.","00:06:56,300","00:07:00,600",True
"355","1","7","Penny","How am I supposed to plan my bodily functions?","00:07:28,500","00:07:30,500",False
"356","1","7","Sheldon","- Why? - It's culturally universal. A bed, even a temporary bed, is always oriented with the headboard away from the door. It serves the ancient imperative of protecting oneself against marauders.","00:07:46,300","00:07:57,300",True
"357","1","7","Sheldon","Yes, if you use my toothbrush, I'll jump out that window.","00:08:04,600","00:08:08,100",True

"360","1","7","Leonard","I know. You have a TV in your room. Why don't you just have breakfast in bed?","00:10:22,500","00:10:27,000",True
"361","1","7","Sheldon","Because I am neither an invalid, nor a woman celebrating Mother's Day.","00:10:27,200","00:10:30,700",True
"362","1","7","Sheldon","Okay, this cereal has lost all its molecular integrity. I now have a bowl of shredded wheat paste.","00:10:44,600","00:10:49,300",True
"363","1","7","Penny","Why do you people hate sleep? Are you wearing my robe?","00:10:56,600","00:11:01,200",True

"372","1","7","Howard","If you'll excuse me, I have some Bar Mitzvah bonds to cash.","00:13:39,500","00:13:43,600",True
"373","1","7","Sheldon","Let me walk you through it. Our standard order is: the steamed dumpling appetizer, General Tso's chicken, beef with broccoli, shrimp with lobster sauce and vegetable lo mein. Do you see the problem?","00:13:56,900","00:14:07,500",True

"376","1","7","Leonard","Can we get an order of dumplings but with three instead of four?","00:14:50,800","00:14:53,400",False
"377","1","7","Leonard","Fine. Bring us three orders of dumplings. - That's 12. We'll each have four. - That works.","00:15:01,200","00:15:06,100",False

"552","1","9","Sheldon","Oh, I see. It was the apple falling on Newton's head, - was that just an anecdote? - You are not Isaac Newton.","00:14:46,200","00:14:51,900",False
"553","1","9","Sheldon","No, no, that's true. Gravity would have been apparent to me without the apple.","00:14:52,000","00:14:55,300",True
"554","1","9","Leonard","Look, if you weren't happy with my presentation then maybe you should have given it with me!","00:15:00,900","00:15:04,700",False
"555","1","9","Sheldon","Oh, please. I admit that spherical chicken joke, - that was hilarious. - Thank you. But it was straight downhill from there.","00:15:14,700","00:15:20,100",True
"556","1","9","Leonard","I've had enough of your condescendship. Maybe I didn't go to college when I was 11 like you. Maybe I got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16 but you are not the only person who is smarter than everyone else in this room! No offense.","00:15:20,300","00:15:34,000",True

"561","1","9","Sheldon","I really don't understand what you're so unhappy about. You begged me to come, I came. There's just no pleasing you.","00:16:50,700","00:16:55,400",True
"562","1","9","Leonard","You're right, I'm the problem, I'm the one that needs help.","00:16:56,400","00:16:59,000",False

"567","1","10","Sheldon","I don't guess. As a scientist, I reach conclusions based on observation and experimentation. Although as I'm saying this, it occurs to me you may have been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot.","00:01:44,216","00:01:55,362",True

"573","1","10","Sheldon","I would suggest something to the effect of: singing is neither an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you, and if you disagree, I'd recommend you have a CAT scan to look for a tumor pressing on the cognitive processing centers of your brain.","00:05:02,243","00:05:14,025",False
"574","1","10","Leonard","I couldn't say that. I would have to say, ""You were terrific and I can't wait to hear you sing again.""","00:05:16,101","00:05:21,699",True
"575","1","10","Leonard","That's the social protocol. It's what you do when you have a friend who's proud of something they really suck at.","00:05:24,400","00:05:30,792",True
"576","1","10","Sheldon","When we played chess earlier, you were terrific, and I can't wait to play you again. Good night.","00:05:37,834","00:05:42,387",False

"586","1","10","Leonard","I don't get it. I already told her a lie. Why replace it with a different lie?","00:08:19,825","00:08:24,039",False
"587","1","10","Sheldon","First of all, your lie was laughably transparent, where mine is exquisitely convoluted. While you were sleeping, I was weaving an un-unravelable web.","00:08:24,471","00:08:33,758",True
"588","1","10","Sheldon","If she Googles ""Leopold Houston,"" she'll find a Facebook page, an online blog depicting his descent into drug use and a desperate yet hopeful listing on eHarmony.com.","00:08:37,569","00:08:46,221",True
"589","1","10","Leonard","Okay, why would I go to a drug intervention for your cousin?","00:08:48,115","00:08:51,706",False
"590","1","10","Sheldon","Because it's in Long Beach, and I don't drive.","00:08:52,036","00:08:54,638",True
"591","1","10","Sheldon","- Of course not. There's no cousin Leo. There's no intervention. Focus, Leonard.","00:08:56,615","00:09:01,786",False
"592","1","10","Sheldon","We just leave the house on Friday night and we return in the wee hours, emotionally wrung out, from the work of convincing Leo to go back into rehab.","00:09:04,508","00:09:11,755",False
"593","1","10","Sheldon","For a noble purpose-- to spare me the social embarrassment of having a drug-addled first cousin-- which I'm assuming is embarrassing, yes?","00:09:22,141","00:09:30,064",False
"594","1","10","Sheldon","That's the best part. You don't have to. I told Penny that you would be embarrassed if you knew that she found out that you had lied, so she's agreed to operate as if the original lie is still in force.","00:09:33,885","00:09:43,642",True
"595","1","10","Penny","I got to tell you, a lot of friends would let their friend go alone, but that's not who you are. You are the kind of guy who stands by a friend when... Wen he has a symposium to go to.","00:10:15,868","00:10:25,906",False
"596","1","10","Howard","Wait a minute. Farmanfarmian is speaking and you're bogarting the symposium?","00:10:54,989","00:10:58,402",False

"600","1","10","Sheldon","No, that's the least of our worries. I've been doing some research on addiction, both the biochemical and behavioral aspects-- and I think there's a problem with the current version of our lie.","00:13:17,119","00:13:26,725",False
"601","1","10","Leonard","What are you talking about? It's fine! She bought it; it's over.","00:13:26,886","00:13:29,854",True

"603","1","10","Sheldon","You didn't read the bio, did you? He's not just a middle child, he is the quintessential middle child-- from a broken home, to boot. Psychologically speaking, the attention he gets by rebelling, even to the point of self-destruction, is more emotionally valuable than the help he would get at rehab.","00:13:53,493","00:14:08,883",True
"604","1","10","Sheldon","Excuse me, we just went over this. As the quintessential middle child, your addiction is rooted in your unmet need for attention.","00:15:21,507","00:15:28,889",True

"607","1","10","Sheldon","I'm sorry. Leonard, this is Toby Loobenfeld. He's a research assistant in the particle physics lab, but he also minored in theater at MIT.","00:15:38,742","00:15:46,657",False
"608","1","10","Toby","It was more of a double major, actually. Theater and physics. You can guess which one my bourgeois parents pushed me toward.","00:15:47,341","00:15:53,789",False
"609","1","10","Sheldon","You see, while Leo would not have gone into rehab, it is completely plausible that we would have talked him into leaving the motel and coming home with us.","00:15:57,411","00:16:05,759",True
"610","1","10","Sheldon","No. We're going with middle child and a genetic predisposition to inadequate serotonin production.","00:16:15,901","00:16:22,026",False
"611","1","10","Sheldon","Unfortunately, we weren't able to convince him to go to rehab.","00:16:41,080","00:16:44,506",True

"613","1","10","Toby","Let me ask you something, Penny. Have you ever woken up in a fleabag motel, covered in your own vomit, next to a transsexual prostitute?","00:17:08,315","00:17:17,328",False
"614","1","10","Penny","It was okay, I guess. It wasn't a big turnout, but they both really seemed to like it.","00:17:32,947","00:17:37,126",True
"615","1","10","Leonard","As you can see, detoxing can get pretty ugly. Let's give them some privacy.","00:18:38,725","00:18:42,579",False
"616","1","10","Penny","I have a video of me singing last night. Do you want to see it?","00:18:46,369","00:18:49,131",True

"624","1","11","Sheldon","From the data at hand, you really can't draw that conclusion. All you can say with absolute certainty is that that joke is not funny here.","00:01:05,395","00:01:11,657",True
"625","1","11","Penny","- It was the worst trip. Everyone got sick over the weekend.","00:01:20,799","00:01:24,670",False
"626","1","11","Sheldon","I don't need you to guess. I need you to know. Now, when did the symptoms first appear?","00:01:32,225","00:01:37,118",False
"627","1","11","Leonard","Penny, you'll have to excuse Sheldon. He's a bit of a germaphobe.","00:02:04,527","00:02:07,418",False

"632","1","11","Sheldon","We have no idea what pathogen Typhoid she has introduced into our environment. For having never been to Nebraska, I'm fairly certain that I have no corn-husking antibodies.","00:03:30,972","00:03:40,197",True
"633","1","11","Sheldon","When I'm lying comatose in a hospital relying on inferior minds to cure me, these Jell-O cultures and my accompanying notes will give them a fighting chance.","00:03:45,940","00:03:54,118",True

"914","1","15","Sheldon","This has nothing to do with religion. This has to do with the fact that you're a tiny, tiny man who still lives with his mother.","00:13:17,433","00:13:23,901",False

"920","1","15","Sheldon","Now, I am not saying that I should be the sole decider of who you mate with. If you're not attracted to the suitor, the likelihood of conception will be reduced.","00:14:47,707","00:14:55,564",False
"921","1","15","Sheldon","I always thought I was more like a cuckoo bird. You know, a superior creature whose egg is placed in the nest of ordinary birds. Of course, the newly hatched cuckoo eats all the food, leaving the ordinary siblings to starve to death. Luckily for you, that's where the metaphor ended.","00:15:16,497","00:15:31,718",True
"923","1","15","Missy","You listen to me. If you want to start acting like a brother who cares about me, then terrific. Bring it on.

"941","1","16","Leonard","It's no big deal; it's just the way I was raised. My parents focused on celebrating achievements, and being expelled from a birth canal was not considered one of them.","00:01:26,708","00:01:34,764",True
"942","1","16","Sheldon","It's actually based on very sound theories. - His mother published a paper on it. - What was it called?","00:01:37,395","00:01:42,435",True
"943","1","16","Leonard","No, but it was okay. When I was little, I'd think maybe my parents would change their mind and surprise me with a party. Like this one birthday I came home from my cello lesson and I saw a lot of strange cars parked out front. When I got to the door, I could hear people whispering and I could smell German chocolate cake, which is my favorite.","00:02:15,548","00:02:31,988",False
"944","1","16","Leonard","Well, it was kind of like a birthday party. I got to see all my cousins, and there was cake, so...","00:02:39,822","00:02:46,072",True
"945","1","16","Sheldon","What would we talk about? We have no overlapping areas of interest I'm aware of. As you know, I don't care for chitchat.","00:03:45,600","00:03:51,700",True

"960","1","16","Sheldon","Question. How am I going to get Leonard a present before the party? I don't drive and the only things available within walking distance are a Thai restaurant and a gas station.

"1048","1","17","Sheldon","- I would not say that. No one would say that. A light year is a unit of distance not time.","00:14:18,026","00:14:25,044",True

"1070","2","1","","Think back, Leonard. The littlest things can set women off. Like, ""Hey, the waitress is hot, ""I bet we could get her to come home with us."" Or, ""How much does your mom weigh? ""I want to know what I'm getting into.""","00:02:46,497","00:02:58,182",False
"1071","2","1","Raj","They also don't care for it if you stare at them and hyperventilate. Sadly, that's my home run swing.","00:03:02,610","00:03:07,538",True

"1428","2","6","Sheldon","Three tines is not a fork. Three tines is a trident. Forks are for eating, tridents are for ruling the seven seas.","00:05:06,865","00:05:13,481",True

"1590","2","8","Sheldon","Howard is employing a schoolyard paradigm in which you are, for all intents and purposes, deceased.","00:17:10,225","00:17:15,639",True
"1591","2","8","Sheldon","He intends to act on this by not speaking to you, feigning an inability to hear you when you speak and otherwise refusing to acknowledge your existence.","00:17:17,241","00:17:25,139",True

"1594","2","8","Sheldon","I believe this is an extension of the death metaphor. The cold breeze is the so-called ectoplasmic issue of a disembodied soul passing by.","00:17:44,308","00:17:52,116",True
"1595","2","8","Leonard","Yes, but I don't see a better one on the horizon.","00:18:04,418","00:18:06,547",True

"1599","2","8","Howard","So, anyway, Lisa, I just wanted to tell you again how much I enjoyed the other night, and again, I'm sorry for how it ended.","00:18:44,161","00:18:50,841",True
"1600","2","8","Howard","But again, if you could let me know about Friday. My mother needs a head count so she can know how big a brisket to get.","00:18:53,253","00:18:59,292",True
"1602","2","9","Sheldon","So, do you find the weather satisfying? Are you currently sharing in the triumph of some local sports team?","00:00:13,707","00:00:19,850",True
"1603","2","9","Sheldon","I'm striking up a casual conversation with you.","00:00:23,906","00:00:26,756",False

"1605","2","9","Sheldon","Oh, good, I used that right. Anyway, you're aware that Leonard has entered into a new romantic relationship which includes a sexual component?","00:00:57,644","00:01:07,112",True
"1606","2","9","Sheldon","Her name is Dr. Stephanie Barnett and she is a highly distinguished surgical resident at Freemont Memorial.","00:01:13,989","00:01:18,956",False
"1607","2","9","Sheldon","What he may have left out is how important this relationship is to me.","00:01:20,625","00:01:24,623",True
"1608","2","9","Sheldon","See, of the handful of women Leonard's been involved with, she's the only one I have ever found tolerable.","00:01:28,192","00:01:33,921",True
"1609","2","9","Sheldon","Anyway, should you have any interaction with her, it would be most helpful that she not see you as a sexual rival.","00:01:47,263","00:01:53,184",True
"1610","2","9","Sheldon","You say that now, but consider the following scenario: You're sitting in your apartment, it's late, you're alone. Your hypothalamus is swimming in a soup of estrogen and progesterone and suddenly even Leonard seems like a viable sexual candidate.","00:01:58,323","00:02:13,177",True
"1611","2","9","Sheldon","Or a ""hookup"" as it's referred to by today's urban youth.","00:02:15,383","00:02:19,244",True

"1613","2","9","Sheldon","And you said there'd never be enough pasta for the three of us.","00:03:23,075","00:03:26,244",True
"1614","2","9","Sheldon","You know, Italian housewives have a rule of thumb. A handful of dry pasta about an inch in diameter is sufficient for each person as it doubles in volume when cooked.","00:03:28,601","00:03:38,270",True
"1615","2","9","Sheldon","Well, since Leonard seems to be dropping the conversational ball, I guess I'll just have to pick it up.","00:03:46,426","00:03:52,360",True
"1619","2","9","Sheldon","I spent so much of my childhood at that hospital. When I was 12, I got to ride there in a helicopter.","00:04:26,138","00:04:32,149",True
"1620","2","9","Steph","I'm sorry, you tried to build your own CAT scanner?","00:04:39,901","00:04:42,576",False
"1621","2","9","Sheldon","No, I didn't try, I succeeded. In fact, I was briefly able to see the inside of my sister's guinea pig, Snowball, before he caught fire. It led to an interesting expression in our house: ""Not a Snowball's chance in a CAT scanner.""","00:04:42,881","00:04:56,430",True

"1669","2","9","Sheldon","What a beautiful job Stephanie did. I might have gone with a mattress suture instead of a blanket stitch, but you can't argue with her results. It's a shame it won't scar. The war wound is a time-honored badge of masculinity.","00:17:08,519","00:17:21,958",True

"1884","2","12","Penny","You'd have a terrific chance. I mean, you're smart, you're funny. You have a cool job. You build stuff that goes into outer space.","00:15:58,785","00:16:06,921",False
"1886","2","12","Raj","But we don't have a chance. The only improvement you were able to make was to put fresh batteries in the remote.","00:17:16,911","00:17:22,707",True
"1887","2","12","Sheldon","Trust me, Kripke will fall easy prey to my psychological warfare. Observe.","00:17:34,513","00:17:39,192",False
"1888","2","12","Sheldon","I would ask if your robot is prepared to meet its maker, but as you are its maker, clearly the two of you have met.","00:17:43,282","00:17:49,025",True
"1889","2","12","Raj","Way to bust out the Jedi mind tricks, dude.","00:17:57,674","00:18:00,203",True
"1890","2","12","Sheldon","He's right, Leonard. The paradigm is to the death.","00:18:11,674","00:18:14,300",False
"1891","2","12","Sheldon","I'd rather see MONTE dead than in your hands.","00:18:23,403","00:18:25,687",False
"1892","2","12","Leonard","Well, so much for making up for the emotional wounds of childhood.","00:19:14,765","00:19:19,367",True

"1895","2","12","Sheldon","So what do you think, Howard? It's not that bad, right?","00:19:59,432","00:20:03,200",False
"1896","2","12","Penny","Honey, aren't you getting a little carried away? I mean, it's just a toy robot.","00:20:24,951","00:20:28,934",False
"1897","2","12","Howard","Don't get the wrong idea. The way I see it, I'm halfway to pity sex.","00:20:48,513","00:20:52,771",False
"1898","2","13","Sheldon","First off, that is axiomatically wrong because the best pudding is chocolate. Secondly, the organic structure of tapioca makes it a jiggling bowl of potential death. - It is extracted from the plant... - I'm thinking of growing a mustache.","00:00:13,190","00:00:26,527",True
"1899","2","13","Raj","I once saw him shopping at Ralph's. He was buying tequila.","00:00:35,963","00:00:38,709",True
"1900","2","13","Sheldon","Tapioca is extracted from the root of the plant manihot esculenta! Due to a high concentration of cyanide, it is poisonous in its raw form and lethal if prepared improperly!","00:00:53,725","00:01:01,150",True
"1901","2","13","Sheldon","It is also indigenous to Brazil as is the cocoa bean, from which we get chocolate, the best pudding. You promised you wouldn't do that anymore!","00:01:05,721","00:01:12,139",True
"1902","2","13","Raj","Don't feel bad. Negative results are still results.","00:01:27,723","00:01:30,775",True

"1904","2","13","Howard","That's why he eats by himself instead of sitting here at the cool table.","00:01:42,724","00:01:46,652",True
"1905","2","13","Sheldon","It's true Kripke lacks the basic social skills that we take for granted. But he also controls the new open science grid computer that I need to use to run some simulations of structure formation in the early universe.","00:01:52,456","00:02:04,454",False
"1906","2","13","Leonard","Good luck getting time on it. The only people he lets use it are his friends.","00:02:04,624","00:02:08,389",False
"1907","2","13","Sheldon","Then the solution is simple. I shall befriend him.","00:02:08,559","00:02:11,716",True
"1909","2","13","Sheldon","I think we're off to a terrific start.","00:02:39,359","00:02:41,603",True

"1912","2","13","Leonard","- I assumed he was joking. You'd be surprised how many particle physicists have a whimsical side.","00:04:27,758","00:04:34,605",True
"1913","2","13","Penny","What about Howard and Raj? How did he become friends with them?","00:04:35,746","00:04:38,321",False
"1914","2","13","Penny","Well, sure, when you put it that way. But it all worked out, right?","00:04:45,361","00:04:50,623",False
"1915","2","13","Sheldon","- It's a questionnaire I devised. I'm having some difficulty bonding with a colleague at work so I'm doing a little research to better understand why my current friends like me.","00:05:15,333","00:05:25,060",True
"1916","2","13","Penny","Yes, well, that is a good question. But is this really the best way to figure it out?","00:05:26,592","00:05:32,457",False
"1917","2","13","Sheldon","I know, I may have started out with a fairly obvious one; an aspect of my most appealing trait: playfulness.","00:05:56,690","00:06:02,497",True
"1918","2","13","Sheldon","Go ahead and rank that number one. I'm afraid you're on your own for the rest. It should take you no more than three hours.","00:06:04,115","00:06:10,344",True
"1919","2","13","Sheldon","That's certainly a thought-provoking hypothesis. May I suggest it as the topic for your essay?","00:06:32,389","00:06:37,927",True
"1920","2","13","Leonard","Come on. There's over 200 questions. And look at some of these things. ""Sheldon is to camaraderie as the space shuttle is to blank?""","00:07:06,306","00:07:14,755",True
"1921","2","13","Leonard","Hold on. I put some real work into that.","00:07:33,049","00:07:34,965",False
"1922","2","13","Sheldon","Yes, well, it's better than what Wolowitz did. He drew a raccoon with what appears to be a distended scrotum.","00:07:35,090","00:07:41,911",True
"1923","2","13","Sheldon","What hope do I have for establishing new relationships given that my current friends apparently could not take a few hours out of their lives to help me?","00:07:49,423","00:07:56,769",False
"1924","2","13","Leonard","I'm not going to defend a big-balled raccoon.","00:07:56,894","00:07:59,870",True
"1925","2","13","Leonard","What I'm trying to say is that maybe you can't approach this as a purely intellectual exercise.","00:08:02,920","00:08:07,779",False
"1926","2","13","Leonard","Remember when you tried to learn how to swim using the Internet?","00:08:12,602","00:08:16,068",True
"1927","2","13","Sheldon","- The ice caps are melting. In the future, swimming isn't going to be optional. But you do bring up an interesting point. I don't have to break new ground here. I'm sure much of the research already exists.","00:08:27,587","00:08:41,099",False
"1928","2","13","Leonard","No, no, my point is, if you want to learn how to make friends, then just go out to a coffee shop or a museum. Meet people. Talk to them. Take an interest in their lives.","00:08:41,224","00:08:51,031",False
"1930","2","13","Sheldon","- You're driving me to the mall. I'm going to acquire a book that summarizes the current theories in the field of friend-making.","00:08:56,291","00:09:03,377",True
"1931","2","13","Leonard","Why don't you just lie down on the floor and swim there?","00:09:04,556","00:09:08,163",False

"1935","2","13","Sheldon","Good, you're just in time. I believe I've isolated the algorithm for making friends.","00:11:49,593","00:11:54,471",True
"1936","2","13","Howard","Hear him out. If he's really onto something, we could open a booth at Comic-Con. Make a fortune.","00:11:58,382","00:12:03,132",True
"1937","2","13","Sheldon","See, my initial approach to Kripke had the same deficiencies as those that plagued Stu the Cockatoo when he was new at the zoo.","00:12:04,722","00:12:10,889",True
"1938","2","13","Howard","Have you thought about putting him in a crate while you're out of the apartment?","00:12:23,466","00:12:27,538",True
"1939","2","13","Sheldon","All right, Kripke, that last interest strikes me as the least objectionable, and I would like to propose that we do that together. Tomorrow. Yes, I'll pay. All right, good-bye. All right. Time to learn rock climbing.","00:13:57,619","00:14:15,289",True
"1940","2","13","Sheldon","You know, I am a fan of ventriloquism. Maybe you, me and your dummy could go get a hot beverage. He could talk while you drink.","00:14:23,979","00:14:33,219",True
"1941","2","13","Sheldon","A fear of heights is illogical. A fear of falling, on the other hand, is prudent and evolutionary. What would you say is the minimum altitude I need to achieve to cement our newfound friendship?","00:14:54,945","00:15:06,110",False
"1942","2","13","Sheldon","- What part of inverse tangent function approaching an asymptote did you not understand?","00:16:02,626","00:16:07,254",False
"1943","2","13","Sheldon","Well, it's not exactly a plan, but I think I'm going to pass out.","00:16:21,505","00:16:25,284",True
"1944","2","13","Leonard","Sorry, can we please just do it one more time?","00:16:35,935","00:16:37,993",False
"1945","2","13","Leonard","It's a little thing, but you really do miss it.","00:16:56,273","00:16:59,003",True

"1947","2","13","Sheldon","Yes, I pass out all the time, but it was worth it. I've made substantial progress in bonding with Kripke, which brings me to an awkward moment.","00:17:40,971","00:17:50,232",False
"1948","2","13","Howard","Come on. What do I have to do?","00:18:37,239","00:18:39,405",True
"1949","2","13","Penny","Okay, you know what? I see where this is going. I'm not one of you guys. I'm not a scientist, so just tell me...","00:18:40,701","00:18:45,788",False
"1950","2","13","Kripke","I like to floss before I eat so my gum pockets are open for new food.","00:19:19,687","00:19:23,905",False

"1952","2","13","Sheldon","I'm confused. I was given to understand that you allow your friends time on the machine.","00:20:08,692","00:20:13,709",False
"1953","2","13","Raj","And he almost made it to the top this time.","00:20:44,327","00:20:46,611",True

"1956","2","14","Sheldon","Yes, but they have no Icee machines. Despite my aggressive letter-writing campaign, I might add.","00:00:27,281","00:00:33,866",True
"1957","2","14","Raj","What about the multiplex here? The seats are terrific.","00:00:35,114","00:00:37,453",False

"1959","2","14","Sheldon","The delay would result in tomorrow's bowel movement occurring at work.","00:00:52,455","00:00:56,013",True
"1960","2","14","Raj","Hang on, hang on. There's a 7-Eleven here. We smuggle Slurpees, which are essentially Icees, in under our coats, after having a pleasant meal either here, here or here.","00:00:57,511","00:01:07,691",False
"1961","2","14","Sheldon","- He went to the movies without me. It was the only option.","00:02:31,909","00:02:36,429",True
"1962","2","14","Sheldon","I'm sorry, I don't understand which social situation this is. Could you give me some guidance as to how to proceed?","00:02:45,388","00:02:51,496",False

"1964","2","14","Penny","It's no big deal. I'm just a little behind on my bills because they cut back my hours at the restaurant and my car broke down.","00:03:04,398","00:03:09,480",False
"1965","2","14","Sheldon","If you recall, I pointed out the ""check engine"" light to you several months ago.","00:03:09,980","00:03:14,424",True
"1966","2","14","Sheldon","It occurs to me you could solve all your problems by obtaining more money.","00:03:27,108","00:03:30,994",True
"1967","2","14","Penny","- You got a lot of money in there.","00:03:54,179","00:03:57,974",True
"1968","2","14","Sheldon","I see no large upcoming expenditures unless they develop an affordable technology to fuse my skeleton with adamantium like Wolverine.","00:04:39,906","00:04:46,781",True

"1970","2","14","Penny","- I'll pay you back as soon as I can.","00:05:35,446","00:05:38,588",False
"1971","2","14","Sheldon","Of course. That's how you move a conversation forward.","00:06:09,996","00:06:12,412",True
"1972","2","14","Sheldon","The learning opportunities would be abundant. Additionally, I like having my belly scratched.","00:06:14,801","00:06:20,215",True

"1975","2","14","Penny","Whatever. It's not like I'm running up and down the streets just buying myself berets. I bought one a month ago, and it was back-ordered. - Look, it finally arrived, all right? - All right.","00:07:04,379","00:07:13,433",False

"1980","2","14","Howard","He has a nervous bladder when he's stressed out. Kind of like a puppy.","00:08:43,057","00:08:49,220",True
"1981","2","14","Penny","You're damn right it's okay. I've been having leftovers at the restaurant for like four days, and I wanted something different. So sue me.","00:09:03,790","00:09:09,465",False
"1982","2","14","Sheldon","Forgive me, but that would be the very definition of a frivolous lawsuit.","00:09:09,635","00:09:13,880",True

"1989","2","14","Leonard","Back in the pocket it goes. You do understand Sheldon really doesn't care when he gets the money back. It's actually one of the few idiosyncrasies that doesn't make you want to... kill him.","00:10:44,641","00:10:55,838",True
"1990","2","14","Leonard","So you're a little behind on your bills. Everybody gets behind on their bills.","00:10:59,410","00:11:02,660",False

"1993","2","14","Leonard","It's probably not as bad as you think. Let's take a look. Maybe we can find some corners to cut. Here's something. If you don't have electricity, then you probably don't need cable.","00:11:21,178","00:11:31,465",True
"1996","2","14","Penny","No, I can't give up my acting classes. I'm a professional actress.","00:11:40,589","00:11:43,821",False

"2005","2","14","Leonard","Why don't you just get a roommate and stay here?","00:13:08,113","00:13:10,206",False

"2011","2","14","Leonard","You guys want to go on a real live quest?","00:14:11,317","00:14:13,184",False
"2013","2","14","Leonard","Yeah, that's him. Turns out he owes Penny a lot of money, and I'm gonna go get it from him.","00:14:25,748","00:14:30,203",False
"2014","2","14","Leonard","Really? You're just gonna let me go by myself?","00:14:39,169","00:14:41,379",False

"2019","2","14","Sheldon","Which means his triumph will be even larger. Minstrels will write songs about him.","00:16:16,644","00:16:22,601",True
"2020","2","14","Leonard","How about this? I'll do the talking. You just stand behind me and try to look formidable.","00:16:23,359","00:16:28,444",True
"2021","2","14","Leonard","I don't really go by Lenny, but that's okay.","00:16:45,886","00:16:47,672",True
"2023","2","14","Kurt","She sent you to get it from me?","00:17:08,183","00:17:09,610",False
"2024","2","14","Leonard","No, no, she's too proud to ask for the money. I, on the other hand, feel you should honor your debt.","00:17:09,780","00:17:15,284",False
"2025","2","14","Leonard","""Feel"" is a kind of a... it's a strong word. I just think it would be a nice gesture on your part.","00:17:20,652","00:17:25,878",False
"2026","2","14","Raj","A successful quest. Now let's go find a gas station with a clean bathroom.","00:17:36,112","00:17:39,575",True
"2027","2","14","Leonard","No, the problem isn't solved. - He just blew us off. - I've got it.","00:17:40,724","00:17:45,260",False

"2034","2","14","Sheldon","Darn. I can't seem to get the hang of that.","00:19:24,076","00:19:26,776",True
"2035","2","14","Leonard","I know it's none of my business, but where did the money come from?","00:19:27,965","00:19:31,169",False
"2036","2","14","Penny","Well, I cut back my expenses like you said and picked up a few more hours at the restaurant, but the biggest thing was, out of the blue, Kurt shows up and gives me the money he owes me.","00:19:31,337","00:19:40,428",False
"2037","2","14","Penny","He said he was feeling guilty and wanted to do what was right.","00:19:46,631","00:19:49,520",False

"2039","2","14","Sheldon","That's your badge of honor... your warrior's wound, if you will. I was wrong. Minstrels will write songs about you.","00:20:35,367","00:20:43,358",True
"2040","2","15","Howard","Penny, come on. We were just finding our sound.","00:00:29,530","00:00:32,430",True
"2041","2","15","Sheldon","This should be fairly easy to deduce. He's holding the phone to his left ear. Ears do not cross hemispheres, so he's using the analytical rather than the emotional side of the brain, suggesting that he has no personal relationship with the caller.","00:00:55,306","00:01:07,679",True
"2042","2","15","Leonard","No, I didn't realize it had been so long. Sure, I guess there's no other choice but to just go ahead and do it.","00:01:07,804","00:01:14,116",False
"2043","2","15","Woman","Yes, I can read the sign. I'm just pondering the implications.","00:02:17,401","00:02:21,051",True
"2044","2","15","Penny","I think it implies that the elevator doesn't work.","00:02:22,854","00:02:25,904",True
"2045","2","15","Woman","Again, I can read the sign. But the sign and the tape are covered with a layer of dust, which indicates that the elevator has been nonfunctional for a significant amount of time. Which suggests either a remarkable passivity among the, I assume, 24 to 36 residents of this building, based on the number of mailboxes and given typical urban population density or a shared delusion of functionality.","00:02:27,723","00:02:50,680",False
"2046","2","15","Leonard’s","I don't know if I must be, but yes.","00:02:56,275","00:02:58,525",True
"2047","2","15","Beverley","I think you mean young. He's always been little.","00:03:23,174","00:03:26,124",True
"2048","2","15","Beverley","At that age, he was well enmeshed in what Freud would call the phallic stage of psychosexual development. An outmoded theory, of course, but the boy did spend most of his waking hours with a tight grasp on his penis.","00:03:41,603","00:03:52,793",True
"2049","2","15","Beverley","That is one of my degrees. My primary field is neuroscience.","00:03:56,036","00:03:59,586",False
"2050","2","15","Beverley","There are studies that suggest that many who go into the performing arts suffer from an external locus of identity.","00:04:11,775","00:04:17,881",True
"2051","2","15","Beverley","It means you value yourself only as others value you, which is often the result of unmet childhood emotional needs.","00:04:25,058","00:04:32,049",False
"2053","2","15","Penny","I tried being good at sports, but I hated getting dirty!","00:04:46,010","00:04:49,360",True
"2054","2","15","Beverley","If you want to have intercourse with that girl, find out what kind of cologne her father wore.","00:05:13,850","00:05:18,876",True
"2056","2","15","Sheldon","My theory is that his lack of focus stems from an over-developed sex drive.","00:05:52,666","00:05:56,659",True
"2057","2","15","Beverley","I don't know where he would've gotten that. Aside from a pro forma consummation of our marriage, his father and I only had intercourse for the purposes of reproduction.","00:05:58,653","00:06:07,452",True
"2058","2","15","Beverley","It's all online or you can order it from the Princeton University Press.","00:06:28,084","00:06:31,807",True
"2059","2","15","Leonard","If you're lucky, maybe she'll show you the PowerPoint presentation.","00:06:43,336","00:06:47,156",True
"2060","2","15","Beverley","Well, I've been having some fascinating menopausal symptoms recently.","00:07:00,760","00:07:04,760",True
"2061","2","15","Leonard","I hate to tell you, but the only warm memories I have of my childhood are of my Uncle Floyd.","00:07:33,434","00:07:39,051",True
"2062","2","15","Sheldon","You're clearly misremembering. Your mother is brilliant, analytical, insightful. And I'm betting she never hit you with a Bible because you wouldn't eat your Brussels sprouts.","00:07:39,794","00:07:48,758",True
"2063","2","15","Leonard","You don't give your mother enough credit. She's warm, she's loving, she doesn't glue electrodes to your head to measure your brain waves while potty training.","00:07:49,306","00:07:58,778",True
"2064","2","15","Sheldon","You were lucky. When I was a kid, if I wanted an EEG, I had to attach my own electrodes.","00:07:59,421","00:08:05,025",True
"2065","2","15","Howard","So, Dr. Hofstadter, Leonard rarely talks about his incredibly successful brother and sister.","00:08:08,102","00:08:14,117",False
"2066","2","15","Beverley","Leonard's younger brother, Michael, is a tenured law professor at Harvard, and his sister just successfully grew a human pancreas in an adolescent gibbon.","00:08:26,025","00:08:34,227",True
"2067","2","15","Beverley","Why else would you grow a pancreas in a teenaged gibbon?","00:08:38,711","00:08:41,687",True
"2068","2","15","Sheldon","I had no idea your siblings were so much more successful than you.","00:09:01,390","00:09:04,876",True

"2070","2","15","Howard","Next time, don't yousa bring mama to work. Okee-day?","00:09:26,786","00:09:30,281",True
"2071","2","15","Beverley","- The middle stall was occupied. I'll have to try again later.","00:09:32,665","00:09:36,533",True
"2072","2","15","Leonard","- Howard lives with his mother and Raj can't speak to women unless he's drunk. Go.","00:09:45,374","00:09:50,363",True
"2073","2","15","Beverley","That's fascinating. Selective mutism is quite rare. On the other hand, an adult Jewish male living with his mother is so common it borders on sociological cliché.","00:09:52,815","00:10:03,026",True
"2074","2","15","Leonard","He lives in the same room where his bassinet was.","00:10:07,442","00:10:09,900",True
"2075","2","15","Leonard","There's no hurry. Tell them more about their secret love for each other.","00:10:49,609","00:10:52,567",True
"2076","2","15","Beverley","What's the point of my seeing it? I could just read the paper the Italians wrote.","00:11:16,536","00:11:20,882",True
"2077","2","15","Howard","Just for the record, we're not in an ersatz homosexual relationship.","00:11:23,388","00:11:26,864",True
"2078","2","15","Raj","- Then why didn't you say that to her?","00:11:27,437","00:11:30,827",True
"2079","2","15","Raj","It's not always your responsibility. I swear, this is the same thing you did at the comic book store last week.","00:11:31,261","00:11:36,592",True
"2080","2","15","Sheldon","You went to the comic book store without me?","00:11:55,904","00:11:58,508",True
"2081","2","15","Leonard","Relax. She took Sheldon to the hospital to get a brain scan.","00:12:14,276","00:12:17,278",True
"2082","2","15","Leonard","Nothing. Mother likes looking at brains and Sheldon likes getting his brain scanned.","00:12:19,449","00:12:23,781",True
"2083","2","15","Leonard","She's only been here a day and a half and I'm seriously considering alcoholism as a new career path.","00:12:27,902","00:12:32,894",True

"2085","2","15","Leonard","- It's too late for me. My head is her summer house.","00:12:40,844","00:12:45,473",True
"2086","2","15","Penny","Do you know where I was all morning? Auditioning with 50 other blondes for some stupid antidepressant commercial. And for what? So I'll finally get my daddy's approval?","00:12:57,994","00:13:07,615",True
"2087","2","15","Leonard","You want to talk about not getting love from a parent. You know what I used to do when I was little to have some sensation of human contact?","00:13:17,557","00:13:23,678",False
"2088","2","15","Leonard","Of course she did. That's not what I was gonna say. When I was ten years old, I built a hugging machine.","00:13:34,307","00:13:39,573",False
"2089","2","15","Leonard","I got a dressmaker's mannequin, I stuffed it with an electric blanket so it would be warm, and built two radio-controlled arms that would hug me and pat my back.","00:13:43,282","00:13:51,419",True
"2090","2","15","Beverley","Your scan data will be very helpful to my research. You have a remarkable brain.","00:14:03,049","00:14:07,733",True
"2091","2","15","Sheldon","I'd love to see a scan of your brain sometime.","00:14:25,301","00:14:28,160",False
"2092","2","15","Beverley","I'll send you a link, but its physiology is fairly unimpressive.","00:14:28,285","00:14:31,412",False
"2093","2","15","Beverley","Your unwillingness to accept empirical evidence suggests an attempt at flattery.","00:14:33,592","00:14:37,916",True
"2094","2","15","Sheldon","What are the odds that two individuals as unique as ourselves would be connected by someone as comparatively workaday as your son?","00:15:12,451","00:15:20,636",True
"2095","2","15","Beverley","Is that a rhetorical point or would you like to do the math?","00:15:23,124","00:15:26,399",True
"2096","2","15","Sheldon","Normally, I'd feel the same way. But based on everything I've observed about us, I can't help but speculate we'd be very good together.","00:17:11,822","00:17:19,468",False
"2098","2","15","Beverley","It's certainly something I could never do with my husband.","00:17:24,130","00:17:27,117",False

"2100","2","15","Leonard","You shush, I'm happy. I want to talk about it. You know what my mother would say? She would say because you weren't loved by your father and I was not loved by my mother, that having sex is our way of making up for the intimacy we didn't get as children.","00:18:09,923","00:18:22,839",False
"2101","2","15","Penny","So you're saying you're not having sex with me, you're having sex with your mother?","00:18:31,778","00:18:35,905",False
"2103","2","15","Penny","- I was just coming over to talk to you.","00:19:47,688","00:19:50,697",True
"2104","2","15","Penny","I mean, my mom could've just said, ""Bob, get over it, she's a girl, move on.""","00:20:02,119","00:20:06,787",True
"2105","2","15","Penny","- But she didn't. Not one word. - Interesting.","00:20:08,648","00:20:11,752",False

"2113","2","16","Leonard","That shouldn't be a problem. Venus is up during the day. They're probably just all staring at the sky.","00:00:56,141","00:01:00,810",True
"2114","2","16","Howard","Why don't I run away and you cover me?","00:01:17,325","00:01:19,101",False
"2115","2","16","Sheldon","Because you chose your mother's veins over victory. On three. One, two, three, go!","00:01:19,226","00:01:24,622",False
"2116","2","16","Howard","I had to take her! It's almost bathing suit weather!","00:01:28,313","00:01:31,491",True

"2123","2","16","Leslie","I got the approval for the rapid prototyper you wanted.","00:03:40,304","00:03:42,679",False
"2124","2","16","Leonard","Yeah, okay, but what's with the back-scratching and the meow?","00:03:57,817","00:04:01,453",True
"2125","2","16","Sheldon","I believe the back-scratching metaphor generally describes a quid pro quo situation where one party provides goods or services to the second party in compensation for a similar action.","00:04:03,096","00:04:12,250",True
"2126","2","16","Raj","You know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking Howard wasn't making a back-scratching metaphor. I'm thinking there was some actual scratching involved.","00:04:33,329","00:04:40,410",True

"2131","2","16","Howard","One way to look at this is that I'm getting new equipment, and you're not, and that's unfair. But a better way to look at this is that I'm getting sex and you're not, and that's delightful.","00:05:29,301","00:05:40,588",True
"2132","2","16","Penny","The whole thing froze. I don't know what happened.","00:05:43,662","00:05:45,838",False
"2133","2","16","Penny","- How can I calm down? I'm gonna lose my whole shopping cart. That's three hours of picking out shoes just shot to hell.","00:05:45,963","00:05:53,810",True

"2138","2","16","Penny","No, thanks. I'm from Nebraska. When we shoot things, it's because we want to eat them or make them leave our boyfriends alone.","00:07:02,792","00:07:09,427",True

"2576","2","22","Raj","It's not superstition. It's practically Newtonian. For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction. Leonard pretends to be a friend and acts like a two-faced bitch.","00:11:05,041","00:11:13,881",True

"2625","2","23","Sheldon","There are others who might be more qualified, but the thought of interviewing them gave me a stomachache. I know I'm proposing an enormous undertaking. So, why don't you take a few moments to discuss it?","00:05:42,218","00:05:53,101",False

"3253","3","9","Ira","Uh, Dr. Cooper, I think there might be something wrong with our connection.","00:08:44,845","00:08:48,894",False
"3254","3","9","Sheldon","No, I hear you fine. As I was saying, an ordinary magnet has two poles. The primary characteristic of a monopole is that it has only one pole, hence, monopole.","00:08:49,006","00:09:02,404",True
"3255","3","9","Howard","So nice you could join me this evening. You're looking lovely as always.","00:09:24,692","00:09:28,913",True

"3268","3","9","Leonard","Sheldon, what you need to do is figure out a way to exact vengeance on Kripke, like, uh, like, how the Joker got back at Batman for putting him in the Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane.","00:12:09,883","00:12:21,525",False
"3269","3","9","Raj","That's true. He didn't just stay there and talk about his feelings with the other psychotic villains. He, he broke out and poisoned Gotham's water supply.","00:12:21,541","00:12:28,079",True
"3270","3","9","Leonard","Okay, uh, that's the spirit, but, um, let's dial it back to a non-lethal form of vengeance.","00:12:41,450","00:12:48,890",True
"3271","3","9","Penny","Oh, gee, you're too late. Scarlett Johansson and Wonder Woman were just in here trolling around for neurotic, little weasels.","00:13:07,740","00:13:14,502",False

"3276","3","9","Sheldon","All right, how's this for revenge? A solution of hydrogen peroxide, and one of saturated potassium iodide.","00:14:34,746","00:14:44,807",False
"3277","3","9","Leonard","I gotta say, I am really impressed. This is truly the Sheldon Cooper way to get even.","00:15:57,861","00:16:03,722",True

"3280","3","10","Leonard","I think it upsets Sheldon when you play with the food.","00:00:11,400","00:00:13,860",True
"3281","3","10","Sheldon","It upsets Sheldon when she willy-nilly takes it from the containers without regard for its equitable distribution. This is essentially why you have famine in India.","00:00:15,360","00:00:24,230",True
"3282","3","10","Leonard","It upsets Sheldon when you play with the Sheldon.","00:00:30,630","00:00:34,500",True

"3284","3","10","Howard","I hope it's all right- I told my girlfriend Bernadette she could join us for dinner.","00:00:55,960","00:00:59,830",False
"3285","3","10","Sheldon","Wa- no, that's a false equivalency. More does not equal merry. If there were 2,000 people in this apartment right now, would we be celebrating? No, we'd be suffocating.","00:01:00,900","00:01:09,560",True
"3286","3","10","Penny","Oh, come on, it's fine. We'll just put it all on the table, you know, family style.","00:01:13,160","00:01:17,060",False
"3287","3","10","Sheldon","Oh, sure. And while we're at it, why don't we put our hands behind our backs, have an old-fashioned eating contest?","00:01:17,130","00:01:21,660",True
"3288","3","10","Penny","No, no, no- you see, in the winter, that seat is close enough to the radiator so that he's warm, yet not so close that he sweats. In the summer, it's directly in the path of a cross-breeze created by opening windows there and there. It faces the television at an angle that isn't direct, so he can still talk to everybody, yet not so wide that the picture looks distorted.","00:01:37,900","00:01:55,200",True
"3289","3","10","Bernadette","Don't take him too seriously. A lot of what he says is intended as humor.","00:02:57,300","00:03:02,730",True
"3290","3","10","Bernadette","Me neither, but he just lights up when I laugh.","00:03:05,060","00:03:08,660",True
"3291","3","10","Bernadette","So, Leonard, Howard says you're working on fundamental tests of quantum mechanics.","00:03:15,630","00:03:19,160",False
"3292","3","10","Leonard","Actually, my tests of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum interference effect have reached an interesting point. Right now, we're testing the phase shift due to an electric potential.","00:03:30,260","00:03:37,760",False
"3293","3","10","Sheldon","Leonard's work is nearly as amazing as third graders growing lima beans in wet paper towels.","00:03:40,230","00:03:45,230",True
"3294","3","10","Sheldon","While I appreciate the ""Oh, snap,"" I'm uncomfortable having your moist breath in my ear.","00:03:47,230","00:03:52,400",True
"3295","3","10","Bernadette","Are you going to try to set up the voltages using tunnel junctions?","00:03:55,600","00:03:59,800",True

"3297","3","10","Penny","Hey, Sheldon, can I talk to you for a second?","00:05:01,030","00:05:04,000",True
"3298","3","10","Sheldon","It's not about shoes, is it? I don't think I could go through that again.","00:05:04,060","00:05:08,800",True
"3299","3","10","Sheldon","Can't you surprise him in some other way? For example, I'm sure he'd be delightfully taken aback if you cleaned your apartment.","00:05:54,060","00:06:00,330",True
"3300","3","10","Sheldon","this would be a massive undertaking, and my time is both limited and valuable.","00:06:04,200","00:06:08,360",False
"3301","3","10","Penny","Yeah, actually, it was pretty cool. A lot of the girls threw up, but I gutted that thing like a deer.","00:06:27,300","00:06:31,730",True
"3302","3","10","Sheldon","I suppose if someone could teach sign language to KoKo the gorilla... I could teach you some rudimentary physics.","00:06:43,630","00:06:51,260",False
"3303","3","10","Howard","Thought I'd give the little woman a tour of the old salt mines.","00:07:18,600","00:07:22,030",False

"3363","3","11","Sheldon","It's what we think caused your narcissistic personality disorder. We discussed it at length during our last video chat. Although how we got onto the subject of you is baffling.","00:05:58,160","00:06:09,120",True

"4467","4","7","Raj","It doesn't matter; they'll find a reason to give me a one-way ticket back to Gandhi-ville. By the way, when I say that, it's not offensive.","00:01:27,103","00:01:34,126",True

"4496","4","7","Sheldon","I don't understand why you people are picking on my friend, Howard, when there are much more serious security threats to pursue.

"4511","4","7","Sheldon","Ah. Blame President James ""Jimmy"" Carter. He started America on a path to the metric system but then just gave up. He wonders why he was a one-term president.","00:16:03,967","00:16:14,643",False
"4512","4","7","Sheldon","I believe you were about to ask me to choose a cocktail. Fortunately, thanks to computer-savvy alcoholics, there's an app for that. Let's see. Harvey Wallbanger. Eh.

"4515","4","7","Penny","You know, sometimes stuff just happens, and there's nothing you can do about it.

"4523","4","8","Penny","You know, I could totally rock a hat like that.","00:00:43,799","00:00:46,067",False
"4524","4","8","Sheldon","That's the work of noted Hollywood costume designer Deborah Nadoolman. She also designed the iconic red and black jacket in Michael Jackson's <i>Thriller</i> video, which I've never viewed in its entirety, as I find zombies dancing in choreographed synchronicity implausible.

"4529","4","8","Penny","21 seconds? That'll be like seeing a whole new movie!","00:01:26,192","00:01:30,879",True

"4537","4","8","Leonard","Oh. Well, he waited in line for 14 hours, while you napped in a lawn chair, he got in a fight with a Klingon when he stepped out of line to pee and you wouldn't wake up to vouch for him, and worst of all, he saw <i>Star Trek: Nemesis.</i>","00:03:10,406","00:03:23,352",True

"5066","4","15","Leonard","Swell. I need a drink. Do we have any alcohol?","00:13:01,542","00:13:06,279",True

"5069","4","15","Howard","Wait-wait-wait. Are you telling us that old lady wanted to have sex with you in exchange for giving your department millions of dollars?","00:13:38,310","00:13:45,917",False
"5070","4","15","Leonard","I was able to get out of there before anything else happened, but she wants to see me again tomorrow night.","00:13:53,925","00:13:58,061",True
"5071","4","15","Leonard","Well, n-no, hold on a second, I'm not going to sleep with her.","00:14:08,605","00:14:12,541",False

"5075","4","15","Sheldon","Just a few things you may need tonight. Baby oil, condoms and, uh... a little something I procured from the school of pharmacology. They say it is to Viagra as Viagra is to a green M&M.","00:14:56,851","00:15:08,494",True

"5077","4","15","Sheldon","Maybe this will overcome your reluctance. I went on the Internet and found a photograph of a 25-year-old Mrs. Latham to get your libido humming.","00:15:15,234","00:15:23,641",True
"5079","4","15","Mrs","No, it most certainly is not. Leonard, I'm making the donation to your department regardless of what happens between us.","00:16:18,261","00:16:24,732",True

"5082","4","15","Penny","Oh, please, I recognize the walk of shame when I see it. All you're missing is a little smeared mascara and a purse with panties wadded up in it.","00:17:58,220","00:18:06,394",True
"5083","4","15","Penny","I believe that's what your roommate did to her.","00:18:28,215","00:18:31,084",True

"5085","4","15","Sheldon","That's a good idea; get your rest. There are a lot more rich old ladies out there, and Daddy needs a new linear accelerator.","00:18:47,701","00:18:53,605",True

"5099","4","16","Sheldon","Point of inquiry, given that Leonard is your secondary friend and Koothrappali is your primary friend, why didn't you seek refuge under his roof?","00:05:14,695","00:05:24,137",False
"5100","4","16","Howard","I don't know. A couple of days ago. The thing is, Bernadette doesn't like that I have to take care of my mother, and my mother doesn't trust Bernadette...","00:05:42,623","00:05:50,297",True
"5101","4","16","Priya","Get out of the way. What are you doing here?","00:06:36,043","00:06:40,714",True

"5106","4","16","Sheldon","Well, just keep in mind that should you ever need a slightly apathetic tertiary friend, I stand at the ready.","00:08:00,294","00:08:08,635",False
"5107","4","16","Raj","Why are you holding hands? I forbid you to hold hands.","00:08:11,538","00:08:15,241",True

"5112","4","16","Sheldon","Priya, if you're experiencing any tension or awkwardness, it may stem from the fact that Leonard and Penny used to-- if I may quote Howard-- ""do the dance with no pants.""","00:09:38,292","00:09:48,301",True
"5113","4","16","Howard","Hey, Bernadette, can I talk to you for a second?","00:09:55,643","00:09:58,361",False

"5115","4","16","Bernadette","That's your big solution to all of our problems? If your mom's nose holds up, we get two nights together?","00:10:20,668","00:10:25,872",False
"5116","4","16","Amy","To comfort you, of course. Sheldon told me about Leonard dating Rajesh's sister. So I high-tailed it over here to pick up the pieces of your broken heart.","00:10:58,409","00:11:06,542",True
"5117","4","16","Amy","You don't have to be strong for me. Now let's talk about Priya, that man-stealing bitch.","00:11:08,645","00:11:14,300",True

"5119","4","16","Amy","Oh. Then perhaps you don't understand what's going on. Your former boyfriend has replaced you with what appears to be a very suitable mate. Arguably much more suitable than you.","00:11:28,515","00:11:39,341",True
"5120","4","16","Penny","Oh. Well, good for him. Hey, what do you mean, ""more suitable""?","00:11:41,277","00:11:45,547",True
"5121","4","16","Amy","Well, granted, Penny, your secondary sexual characteristics are reasonably bodacious. But Priya is highly educated, she's an accomplished professional, and she comes from the culture that literally wrote the book on neat ways to have sex. Whereas you, on the other hand, are a community college dropout who comes from the culture that wrote the book on tipping cows.","00:11:45,548","00:12:06,368",True
"5122","4","16","Penny","Yeah. Okay, I got it. I got it. So... what is all that stuff?","00:12:06,369","00:12:12,808",False

"5129","4","16","Raj","All the more shame that will fall upon the house of Hofstadter.","00:13:51,174","00:13:54,843",True
"5130","4","16","Sheldon","No, no. It's not an imposition. At this point, in our ecosystem, you are akin to the plover, a small scavenging bird that eats extra food from between the teeth of crocodiles.","00:14:13,396","00:14:23,639",True
"5131","4","16","Sheldon","Please, fly into our open maw, and have at it.","00:14:25,408","00:14:28,644",True
"5132","4","16","Penny","If I had more than a box of baking soda in my refrigerator, I wouldn't have to take that.","00:14:30,847","00:14:34,716",True
"5133","4","16","Leonard","Oh, come on. It's not boring at all. She's currently helping set up a secondary derivative market which would allow overseas car firms to hedge their investments against potential advancements in battery technology.","00:14:48,998","00:15:02,277",True
"5134","4","16","Penny","Oh, yeah, yeah. It's real great. Today I drove to Van Nuys for an audition I thought was going to be for a cat food commercial. Turned out to be porn.","00:15:24,801","00:15:31,640",True
"5135","4","16","Sheldon","Given the state of your career, can you really afford to be picky?","00:15:39,249","00:15:42,985",True

"5138","4","16","Howard","Better put it on the list. If you wash my underwear with regular soap, <i>I get little red bumps on my tuchus.</i>","00:16:58,394","00:17:04,299",True
"5139","4","16","Howard","Well, honey, it's not gonna do itself. Oh, before I forget, tomorrow morning, you're driving me to the dentist.","00:17:10,673","00:17:17,863",False
"5140","4","16","Bernadette","Wait a minute. Are you telling me your mother usually takes you to the dentist?","00:17:24,454","00:17:28,590",False
"5141","4","16","Bernadette","All right, Howard, let's get something straight right now. I'm not going to be your mother.","00:17:42,705","00:17:47,442",False
"5142","4","16","Mrs","<i>You know I can't turn on that ferkakta computer!</i> I left you some brisket on the kitchen counter!","00:18:11,000","00:18:18,507",True
"5143","4","16","Amy","It seems like the appropriate thing to do when one's best friend finds herself replaced by a smart, beautiful woman with the smoldering sexuality of a crouched Bengal tiger.","00:18:32,422","00:18:41,396",True
"5144","4","16","Penny","I already told you, I'm okay with it. I mean, if anything, I'm quite pleased that Leonard has found someone (sobbing): that makes him so happy.","00:18:41,397","00:18:52,591",True
"5145","4","16","Amy","Now, let's get these electrodes attached and see what's going on in that pretty little noggin of yours.","00:18:56,312","00:19:00,632",True
"5146","4","17","Leonard","I'm having dinner with Priya at Raj's. I think Howard's going to be there. You want to join us?","00:00:25,209","00:00:28,711",True
"5147","4","17","Sheldon","Well, I don't want to go to a party.","00:00:52,469","00:00:54,854",False
"5148","4","17","Leonard","It's not a party. It's the same group of people who hang out here hanging out over there.","00:00:54,855","00:00:58,524",False
"5149","4","17","Sheldon","I'm sorry, but five people eating and chatting is a party.","00:00:58,525","00:01:02,111",False
"5150","4","17","Leonard","How come it's not a party when we do it here?","00:01:02,112","00:01:04,847",False
"5151","4","17","Sheldon","Well, no, sir, and do you know why? In a word: tradition. Every Thursday night for the last eight years, you and I and our friends have gathered here in this very spot to break bread covered with cheese and sauce, discuss the issues of the day, and yes, share a laugh or two. But I guess our rich heritage means nothing to you.","00:01:11,488","00:01:34,343",False
"5152","4","17","Sheldon","But what if he does? I'll be obliged to dine on liver and lungs stuffed in a sheep's stomach. And frankly, blood pudding is essentially the same thing. I don't know why he's serving both.","00:01:50,994","00:02:01,337",True
"5153","4","17","Leonard","What do you want to do? You want to come with me, or do you want to sit here alone?","00:02:01,338","00:02:05,274",False
"5154","4","17","Sheldon","And be a social pariah? Oh, you know that's not my style.","00:02:51,277","00:02:54,846",True
"5155","4","17","Sheldon","The audible sigh is a show of exasperation, right?","00:02:59,185","00:03:02,754",False
"5156","4","17","Howard","That's got to be fun for you, huh? Watching Hofstadter suck the saliva out of your sister's mouth?","00:03:21,607","00:03:29,314",True
"5157","4","17","Sheldon","Excuse me. Before this evening goes any further, we need to decide where everyone is going to sit.","00:03:30,549","00:03:36,187",True

"5159","4","17","Sheldon","Sadly, Penny, this evening, I am the Dark Knight, roaming these mean streets alone. A windbreaker for my cape, and a stern expression for my cowl.","00:04:24,770","00:04:36,714",False
"5160","4","17","Sheldon","I don't think your heart's in it, but since you asked... Apparently, because Leonard is dating Raj's sister, we're all forced to hang out at his apartment.","00:05:00,406","00:05:09,364",True
"5161","4","17","Sheldon","Yeah, at one point, Raj put on reggae music, and his sister took off her shoes. It was like the last days of Caligula.","00:05:13,202","00:05:20,224",True
"5163","4","17","Amy","Sheldon, are you all right? When last we spoke, you were going to take a taxi home from Raj's, but according to Facebook, you just checked in at the Cheesecake Factory.","00:05:35,507","00:05:43,581",False
"5164","4","17","Sheldon","Yes, I was in a taxi, but the driver didn't look at all like the photograph on his license, so I leapt out and ran for it.","00:05:43,582","00:05:51,589",True

"5182","4","17","Amy","If you'd have let me bring the chloroform, we wouldn't have had to put up with all this jibber-jabber.","00:11:41,431","00:11:46,602",True
"5183","4","17","Zack","Anyway, after we get done snowboarding, I go back to the lodge and get in the Jacuzzi. There's no one around, so naturally, I'm free-balling it.

"6000","5","5","Penny","No, no, I didn't forget. Um, there's this cat in a box and until you open it, it's either dead or alive or both.

"6641","5","14","Amy","What's baffling me is what you could've possibly put on the list. ""Hair too golden""? ""Laugh too musical""? ""World too much a better place for her mere presence in it""?","00:09:21,983","00:09:35,329",False

"7272","6","1","Sheldon","You don't even know what it is, do you? The anthropic principle states that if we wish to explain why our universe exists the way it does, the answer is that it must have qualities that allow intelligent creatures to arise who are capable of asking the question.

"7279","6","1","Sheldon","As I've stated before on numerous occasions, the only sea creature I would even consider being eaten by is the Kraken, because the last words I would hear are: ""Release the Kraken.""

"7438","6","3","Amy","And there you have it; prefrontal cortex reasoning versus limbic lust. If this were a boxing match, they might call it ""The thrilla adjacent to the amygdala."" (laughs) If you were a brain scientist, you would be busting a gut right now!","00:16:09,125","00:16:25,941",True

"7440","6","3","Leonard","Mmm, the nurse is a woman, so he couldn't talk to her. She had to bring him a Grover puppet so he could point at what hurt.","00:16:46,129","00:16:54,869",True

"7456","6","4","Howard","Great. Just keep in mind astronauts lose a lot of muscle tone in space, so you might have to do most of the heavy lifting.","00:03:29,734","00:03:37,383",False

"7610","6","7","Sheldon","Yeah, I did, but then Wil called Amy a pain in the A-S-S. She got huffy and left, then Wil and I headed out to dinner. That place really did remind me of my hometown. Because there we also have a HomeTown Buffet.","00:06:50,588","00:07:06,085",True
"7611","6","7","Sheldon","Enjoyed a delightful dinner at a reasonable price. The manager recognized Wil and let us sit right next to the frozen yogurt machine. Right next to it! I was closer to it than I am to you right now.","00:07:18,533","00:07:32,812",False

"7614","6","7","Sheldon","Hmm. Eat one of your Luna bars. Very often when women think they're angry, they're really just hungry.","00:08:18,493","00:08:28,818",True
"7615","6","7","Sheldon","Precisely, I didn't do anything. Now does someone feel like checking her emotional math?","00:08:34,375","00:08:42,231",False

"7619","6","7","Howard","No excuse. It's just, you know, I'm Jewish, and technically, we're not supposed to drive or carry anything on the Sabbath. So this one's on God.","00:09:22,240","00:09:31,881",True
"7620","6","7","Bernadette","That might be a little more convincing if you didn't have a mouthful of bacon cheeseburger.","00:09:31,883","00:09:36,268",True
"7621","6","7","Howard","I will. I'm obviously not going to live in my mother's house for the rest of my life. I'm not a child.","00:09:50,184","00:09:55,321",False
"7622","6","7","Howard","She did not burp me. She was patting me on the back, and I happened to burp.","00:10:00,160","00:10:05,631",True

"7625","6","7","Howard","All right, I've had enough of this. I'm a grown man, I have a successful career. For the love of God, I've been to space! I will move out when I'm ready, and I don't need anyone badgering me into it!","00:10:17,628","00:10:28,387",False

"7628","6","7","Howard","I can't believe I'm not going to live here anymore. This has always been my bedroom. Right here is where my mom used to mark my height.","00:12:16,979","00:12:27,021",False
"7629","6","7","Howard","I remember when I was five, hiding under this desk with all my Halloween candy.

"7633","6","7","Penny","I had a feeling we'd have a talk like this sooner or later. Are you finally getting fuzz in weird places?","00:13:39,646","00:13:48,302",False
"7634","6","7","Sheldon","Well, it's been a rough day. I usually go chamomile tea, but I don't think that's going to cut it.","00:14:03,786","00:14:08,856",False

"7638","6","7","Penny","Far be it from me to criticize a man with a full pubis. Look, Sheldon, your problem is not Wil Wheaton, okay? Your problem is the way you treated Amy.","00:15:38,548","00:15:48,539",False
"7639","6","7","Sheldon","On the other hand, that low-down polecat done wronged my woman.","00:16:06,108","00:16:09,343",True

"7642","6","7","Howard","You know, she's why I first got into magic. I would do little shows for her, hang up a bedsheet like it was a curtain, put on a top hat and cape. And part way through the act, I would say I needed a volunteer from the audience to be my beautiful assistant and invite her up on stage. I can still remember the way she'd smile. For a few minutes, she'd... forget how lonely she was.","00:17:31,910","00:18:02,773",False
"7643","6","7","Bernadette","Well, you should've thought of that before you told me the stupid magic trick story.","00:18:15,188","00:18:19,423",True

"7652","6","9","Sheldon","If a zombie bites you, you turn into a zombie. However, if a mummy bites you, all you turn into is some schmo with a mummy bite. So, like a zombie, that's been eaten from the waist down, you, sir, have no leg to stand on.","00:00:29,689","00:00:44,636",False
"7653","6","9","Howard","Guess who picked up his new car this morning?","00:00:58,318","00:01:01,986",False

"7658","6","9","Sheldon","Well, I don't want another parking space. I want my parking space. It's perfect. I-it's a corner spot, cutting the risk of door-dings in half. It's a mere 28 steps from the building entrance. Uh, the nearby tree provides shade on hot days and is also home to a delightful squirrel. Which is fortuitous because most squirrels are real jerks.","00:01:40,026","00:02:00,778",True
"7659","6","9","Sheldon","Don't try to change the subject. This is about a parking space. It has nothing to do with cars.","00:02:06,586","00:02:11,673",True
"7660","6","9","Sheldon","I always listen to myself. It's one of the great joys of my life. Now, get your car out of my spot.","00:02:13,960","00:02:20,231",False
"7661","6","9","Sheldon","Yeah, that was five weeks ago. How much longer is he gonna milk that cow?","00:03:52,165","00:03:55,967",True
"7662","6","9","Sheldon","No, no, this is a slippery slope, Leonard. It starts with a parking space. Where does it end? It's like my dad always said, ""First they say you can't drink and drive. ""Next thing you know, you can't let your 10-year-old take the wheel while you sleep one off in the backseat.""","00:03:59,523","00:04:14,069",False
"7663","6","9","Leonard","All that story does is make me feel bad for your mother.","00:04:14,071","00:04:18,957",True

"7668","6","9","Amy","I guess this is what we get for being with two testosterone-fueled alpha males. At some point, they're bound to lock horns.","00:06:19,112","00:06:27,586",False
"7669","6","9","Bernadette","I'm really sorry they took Sheldon's spot away. He shouldn't have to suffer just because Howard's such a big deal now.","00:06:33,009","00:06:39,180",False
"7670","6","9","Amy","I know, Sheldon should just let Howard have his little moment in the sun.","00:06:39,182","00:06:43,134",False

"7672","6","9","Penny","maybe we should change the subject. Amy, how are your lady parts? Still chilly down there?","00:07:03,123","00:07:07,692",True
"7673","6","9","Amy","Well, at least when we do make love, Sheldon won't be thinking about his mother.","00:07:52,288","00:07:57,241",False
"7674","6","9","Amy","And yes, that is a cleverly veiled reference to Howard's lifelong obsession to crawl back into her spacious womb.","00:07:59,378","00:08:05,350",True
"7675","6","9","Penny","Anyway, to this day, I still can't see a box of crayons without crossing my legs.","00:08:06,802","00:08:11,255",False
"7676","6","9","Bernadette","I don't have to take this. I'm gonna go home and have sex with my husband right now. Maybe I'll let him do it to me in the parking spot.","00:08:11,257","00:08:20,865",True
"7677","6","9","Bernadette","Which sounds dirty, but I didn't mean it that way!","00:08:22,051","00:08:25,937",True

"7681","6","9","Howard","Well, we appear to have reached an impasse. And you know, I have to say, I thought you'd be more upset that your laptop is sitting on my junk.","00:09:31,704","00:09:40,462",True
"7682","6","9","Sheldon","Yes, and be sure and put on the emergency brake. Really makes these things tough to budge.","00:10:28,987","00:10:33,240",False

"7702","6","9","Howard","I had no idea just how much Howard... that's not how we practiced it. I had no idea how much that spot meant to you. Anyway, I called President Siebert and told him it's not worth fighting over the spot, so you keep it, and I'll park in the structure across the street.","00:16:10,128","00:16:34,417",False

"7705","6","9","Sheldon","A naked man sat on it. Now, here's my concern. His diet is rich in fatty deli meats. What test do you have to detect lipid residue?","00:18:32,672","00:18:45,015",True
"7706","6","10","Sheldon","Is anyone else troubled by the Spider-Man theme song?","00:00:02,443","00:00:06,496",False
"7707","6","10","Leonard","Why would it trouble you? It's, like, your third favorite cartoon theme song.","00:00:06,498","00:00:10,984",False

"7709","6","10","Sheldon","I can think of many things Spider-Man can't do that a spider can. One: crawl in your ear and die. Two: legally leave Guatemala without a passport. Three: have sex with a spider.","00:00:31,273","00:00:44,868",False
"7710","6","10","Raj","I know, but that sounds anti-Semitic. Anyway, I was thinking we could have a little film festival tonight. The theme: movies that killed their franchises.","00:00:53,045","00:01:03,670",False

"7713","6","10","Sheldon","No, you can't use that one. That's mine. Uh, try this one for an ice-breaker.

"7720","6","10","Sheldon","Oh, I see the confusion. No, the intent behind that clause was to force <i>you</i> to take care of <i>me</i> when I'm ill. When you're feeling better, you'll think that's funny.","00:03:41,426","00:03:53,703",True

"7742","6","10","Bernadette","Okay, Amy, I brought you some drugs we were working on in the lab. This is proving really good for congestion, but there's a slight chance it can make your tears burn like acid, so if you take it-- happy thoughts.","00:12:21,739","00:12:32,515",False
"7743","6","10","Sheldon","Uh, I'm going to draw you a soothing bath. Where's your bath thermometer?","00:12:34,168","00:12:38,538",False

"7750","6","10","Penny","Now, let's assume, by some miracle, you actually catch a fish. You're going to have to know how to gut it. So, what you're going to do is you're going to take your knife, slice him right up the belly. (gagging)","00:13:38,232","00:13:51,527",True
"7752","6","10","Penny","All right. Now, you don't want to cut too deep into its guts, or the blood will just squirt all over your face. (gagging) Oh, my God. What is with you guys?","00:13:55,750","00:14:07,326",False
"7753","6","10","Leonard","It's not our fault. Our dads never did anything like this with us.","00:14:07,328","00:14:11,047",False
"7754","6","10","Raj","Mine just took me to his gynecology office. I got so bored, I'd put vaginal lubricant on the bottom of my shoes and pretend I was ice-skating.","00:14:23,811","00:14:33,402",False
"7755","6","10","Howard","Yeah, well, my quality father-son time was spending my adolescence looking out the window waiting for my dad to come back someday.","00:14:36,957","00:14:44,881",False

"7759","6","10","Sheldon","I'm surprised to hear that. See, the other day, I was concerned that you weren't recovering, so while you were sleeping, I took a cheek swab and had it cultured in the lab.","00:15:49,063","00:15:59,989",False
"7760","6","10","Sheldon","I got the results back. Have you developed any of the following symptoms? A growing nose, or perhaps a warm sensation in the trouser region? Also known as full-blown ""liar, liar, pants on fire.""","00:16:01,576","00:16:17,390",False
"7761","6","10","Sheldon","It hurts that you would lie to me, Amy. I thought our relationship was based on trust and a mutual admiration that skews in my favor.","00:16:26,099","00:16:36,025",True
"7762","6","10","Sheldon","It pains me to say it, but I think some form of penalty is in order, so as to discourage this type of behavior in the future.","00:16:38,413","00:16:46,452",False

"7765","6","10","Sheldon","Oh, that seems overly harsh. You gave in to a hun weakness. You didn't kill a man. You know, it's a tad old-school, but my father was not one to spare the rod when my brother would sneak into his truck and drink his driving whiskey.","00:17:03,187","00:17:21,904",False

"7785","6","11","Leonard","It's actually, ""Ho, ho, ho,"" but you'll get the hang of it. Thought it'd be fun to make a quest with a holiday theme.","00:03:36,272","00:03:43,110",False
"7786","6","11","Sheldon","Mixing Dungeons and Dragons with Christmas is like making a sandwich of grape jelly, the best-tasting jelly, and petroleum jelly, the worst-tasting jelly.","00:03:44,280","00:03:53,571",True

"7843","6","12","Sheldon","Well, you remember when you told me I talk in my sleep? Well, it occurred to me that, like most things I say, it's probably pure gold.

"7860","6","12","Sheldon","Okay, look, it's not really about Ricardo and Tondelaya. It is really about her boss, who doesn't quite know how to handle this situation and could use your advice, which is surprising because Dr. Einstein Von Brainstorm...

"7866","6","12","Sheldon","You don't know? Oh, you poor dear. Your ovaries are squirting so much goofy juice into your brains you don't even know which way is up.","00:07:41,946","00:07:49,384",True

"7869","6","12","Sheldon","Now, there's no need to get defensive. I'm not unsympathetic to your plight. My father used to say that a woman is like an egg salad sandwich on a warm Texas day.","00:08:00,781","00:08:13,909",True

"7877","6","12","Sheldon","I needed advice about a woman. I would have asked you, but if the last few years have proven anything, it's that you can't tell a uterus from a unicycle.","00:10:27,027","00:10:35,434",True
"7878","6","12","Leonard","At least I know not to blab to a girl about somebody flirting with her boyfriend.","00:10:35,436","00:10:41,656",False

"7880","6","12","Sheldon","So I've been told. But I can't understand what she has to complain about. I mean, she has a front-row seat as I make scientific history. There's string cheese in my mini-fridge, and that's for anyone. Yeah, and just yesterday I led her away from a life of sexual promiscuity by making her look at pictures of disease-ridden genitalia.","00:11:45,503","00:12:06,722",True

"7882","6","12","HR","I don't even know what that means, but I'm gonna go ahead and tell you you can't say it.","00:12:36,319","00:12:41,423",True

"7886","6","12","Penny","she is pretty and smart, and when you talk about work, she doesn't have to go home and look up words in the dictionary to understand what you said.","00:14:39,794","00:14:45,881",True
"7887","6","12","Leonard","Hang on. Are you feeling insecure? Because that's my thing, and if you take it away, I don't know what I'm bringing to this relationship.","00:14:50,854","00:14:58,677",True

"7889","6","12","Leonard","What's that? With all these women chasing me, I kind of do feel like Captain Kirk.","00:15:26,924","00:15:32,711",True
"7890","6","12","Penny","Keep talking about Captain Kirk, and we're all gonna stop.","00:15:35,015","00:15:39,601",True
"7891","6","12","Raj","Huh. That is so strange. Human Resources wants to talk to me tomorrow. Could you stop licking your ass for two minutes? I have a problem here.","00:16:17,525","00:16:25,497",True
"7892","6","12","Howard","Do you really think you should be drinking right now?","00:16:36,292","00:16:38,961",False

"7895","6","12","Raj","I feel like I've been called down to the principal's office. Although I wouldn't mind if Brown Sugar suspended me.","00:16:58,044","00:17:03,185",True
"7896","6","12","Raj","From a sex swing! This may have been a mistake.","00:17:05,238","00:17:10,943",True
"7897","6","12","Howard","Relax. Everything's gonna be fine. You know, before I met Bernadette I was in here every other day. Uh, little tip: turn off your ""I Like Big Butts"" ringtone before you go in.","00:17:11,995","00:17:23,872",True
"7898","6","12","Leonard","Yes, but I think this is all a big misunderstanding.","00:17:49,149","00:17:51,850",False

"7900","6","12","Sheldon","But I came to file a complaint. Yeah, somebody has made me feel uncomfortable in the workplace by using language of an inappropriate and sexual nature.","00:18:22,650","00:18:30,906",False
"7901","6","12","Sheldon","And thanks to you, I know better than to ask if you're menstruating.","00:18:50,009","00:18:54,120",True
"7902","6","12","Sheldon","And based on your behavior, I don't have to.","00:18:57,266","00:18:59,434",True

"7904","6","12","Penny","So, hey, I was thinking about that stuff with Alex.","00:19:57,653","00:19:59,693",False
"7905","6","12","Penny","I can't help it. But, look, I figured I could sit around and feel insecure, or I could do something about it. So I got a course catalog at school and looked at some of the science classes.","00:20:01,579","00:20:11,104",False
"7906","6","13","Sheldon","Do you recall this conversation? ""Leonard, want to go halfsies on a steamer?"" ""No, Sheldon, we don't need a steamer."" Looks like that rumpled chicken's come home to roost.","00:00:06,332","00:00:16,891",True

"7910","6","13","Leonard","Well, it's a lot smaller. It's more about the comic books. The way these conventions used to be before they went all Hollywood.","00:00:59,636","00:01:05,356",False
"7911","6","13","Sheldon","So to answer your question, no, it's not better.","00:01:05,358","00:01:08,309",True
"7912","6","13","Sheldon","It's a comic book convention. You know, it's like pizza or particle accelerators, even the stinky one's still pretty good.","00:01:10,730","00:01:17,485",True
"7913","6","13","Penny","Oh, this is the best. You have booze with breakfast on a Tuesday, you got a problem. You do it on the weekend, you got brunch.","00:02:04,180","00:02:10,652",True
"7914","6","13","Amy","Sheldon doesn't believe in brunch. He can't stand being at a table where one person's having an omelet and another person's having a sandwich.","00:02:10,654","00:02:17,609",True
"7915","6","13","Bernadette","It's cute how excited they are. You should have seen Howard sewing his costume all week for the convention.","00:02:35,044","00:02:39,347",False
"7916","6","13","Bernadette","When he was a little boy, every couple months, he would have to let his mom's pants out.","00:02:41,301","00:02:44,853",True

"7918","6","13","Bernadette","I don't mind it. I think Howie's just in touch with his inner child. Although when he comes to bed in his Batman pajamas, sometimes it feels like I'm touching his inner child.","00:02:57,234","00:03:06,825",True
"7919","6","13","Penny","Now I feel bad for picking on all those kids. Although, in my defense, if Danny Biffle didn't want to eat a mouthful of dirt, he shouldn't have shown up to school wearing a bow tie.","00:03:16,386","00:03:26,311",False
"7920","6","13","Bernadette","I've never even read a comic book. You guys?","00:03:26,313","00:03:28,680",False
"7921","6","13","Bernadette","I mean, it's such an important part of their lives. Maybe we should try reading some.","00:03:29,816","00:03:33,401",False
"7922","6","13","Penny","That is an amazing idea. Okay, how many of these have I had?","00:03:38,241","00:03:43,912",True
"7923","6","13","Sheldon","But the turn-by-turn voice option isn't on. I know I'd feel more safe if you turn on the turn-by-turn voice option. I love the turn-by-turn voice option.","00:03:52,255","00:04:01,262",True
"7924","6","13","Leonard","I'm turning it on, but just to shut you up.","00:04:05,502","00:04:08,136",False
"7925","6","13","Sheldon","Ooh, sounds like that fellow knows what he's talking about. I'd put on my listening ears if I were you.","00:04:16,946","00:04:23,234",True
"7926","6","13","Sheldon","I found a hack online. I was able to upload MP3 recordings of my voice to your GPS.","00:04:24,854","00:04:30,825",True

"7929","6","13","Penny","No, we were just wondering why the guys like this stuff so much, so we thought we'd give it a try.","00:06:42,959","00:06:47,629",False
"7930","6","13","Stuart","Oh, okay. What do you think you might be into? Superhero, fantasy, graphic novels, manga-- I swear I will turn a hose on you.","00:06:47,631","00:06:55,670",False
"7931","6","13","Stuart","You can't ask a question like that in here. Are you trying to start a rumble?","00:07:08,501","00:07:13,121",True
"7932","6","13","Penny","As evidenced by your boyfriend and his fear of hamsters.","00:07:30,090","00:07:33,975",True
"7933","6","13","Stuart","If I were you, I'd go for <i>Fables</i> number one. The artwork is sophisticated, it's intelligently written, and it doesn't objectify or stereotype women.","00:07:35,344","00:07:43,401",False
"7935","6","13","Sheldon","What kind of person leaves his keys in the car?","00:10:03,744","00:10:06,328",False
"7936","6","13","Leonard","I thought we agreed this was all Koothrappali's fault.","00:10:06,330","00:10:08,630",False
"7937","6","13","Sheldon","Well, perhaps we should hold up a sign that assures passing motorists of our mental competence.","00:10:33,907","00:10:40,662",True
"7938","6","13","Leonard","Come on, let's just start walking. There's got to be a gas station or something nearby.","00:10:45,752","00:10:50,372",False
"7939","6","13","Sheldon","What, you think just because you're wearing a captain's uniform, you're in charge?","00:10:50,374","00:10:54,343",False
"7940","6","13","Bernadette","I don't know, there were a lot of pictures, and one page only had the word ""brakkadoom!""","00:11:13,364","00:11:19,568",True
"7941","6","13","Amy","and the story moved along at a brisk pace. It was, overall... what's the word I'm looking for?","00:11:29,213","00:11:35,533",True
"7942","6","13","Penny","I don't know how Leonard can get so caught up in this.","00:11:38,104","00:11:40,422",False
"7943","6","13","Bernadette","It's crazy; they spend hours arguing about things that don't even exist.","00:11:40,424","00:11:43,875",False
"7944","6","13","Bernadette","I don't think it's heavy. It's some sort of magic, so only Thor can lift it.","00:11:49,934","00:11:54,937",True
"7945","6","13","Amy","No, no, no, it doesn't. Thor is a god. The hammer is his; only he can use it. It's like Sheldon and his toothbrush. Or his thin, beckoning lips.","00:11:57,074","00:12:11,753",True
"7946","6","13","Penny","Okay, hang on, what if Thor's hand is on the hammer? I mean, if he's touching it with his god magic, does that mean I could lift it?","00:12:13,072","00:12:19,244",True
"7947","6","13","Howard","I wish my mom was here. We could all hang out in her shadow.","00:12:55,164","00:13:01,953",True
"7948","6","13","Raj","Wool pants in the desert. I feel like I've got poached testicles.","00:13:01,955","00:13:07,476",True
"7949","6","13","Raj","Insurance is gonna buy you a new car. It's not gonna de-funk my junk.","00:13:14,935","00:13:20,238",False
"7950","6","13","Leonard","Please, Sheldon, I am so not in the mood.","00:13:27,748","00:13:30,699",False
"7951","6","13","Amy","It says right here on the hammer, ""Whoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.""","00:14:10,907","00:14:17,079",False
"7952","6","13","Amy","Okay, if you're going to start comparing wands and hammers, I can't even take you seriously.","00:14:32,646","00:14:38,934",True
"7953","6","13","Waitress","Why don't you ask Scotty to beam you up?","00:15:11,802","00:15:14,553",True
"7954","6","13","Amy","You can't pick something up in outer space. In space, there is no up.","00:15:35,892","00:15:40,579",True
"7955","6","13","Penny","Oh, yeah? Then how does the sun come ""up"" every day?","00:15:40,581","00:15:44,115",False

"7958","6","13","Leonard","Uh, we're going to the Comic-Con in Bakersfield. They have a big costume contest. It's cooler than it sounds.","00:16:27,877","00:16:36,268",False
"7960","6","13","Howard","She arranged for us to get a rental car.","00:17:05,915","00:17:08,199",True
"7961","6","13","Raj","What about the mission? You said we were a real-life landing party.","00:17:30,056","00:17:32,991",False
"7962","6","13","Sheldon","Yeah, well, we're not. We're an imaginary landing party who had real-life garbage thrown at us by real-life strangers who think we're idiots.","00:17:32,993","00:17:41,833",False
"7963","6","13","Sheldon","And to tell you the truth, I'm starting to feel like one. I want to go home now.","00:17:43,035","00:17:49,240",False
"7964","6","13","Bernadette","Well, what if the Hulk picked up Thor while Thor is holding the hammer?","00:18:06,859","00:18:10,762",False
"7965","6","13","Bernadette","Then by the transitive property of picking things up, Hulk picked up the hammer.","00:18:12,065","00:18:16,401",True
"7967","6","13","Penny","Hey, are we talking about me or are we talking about Thor?","00:18:34,621","00:18:38,340",False
"7968","6","13","Sheldon","Well, I say that's the last time we ever go outside.","00:18:45,231","00:18:49,067",False
"7969","6","13","Penny","No, it's because they're in space. He's really just touching the strap.","00:18:53,690","00:18:57,642",True
"7970","6","13","Sheldon","There's only one logical explanation. Somewhere in the desert we crossed into an alternate dimension... where the women in our lives can finally appreciate great literature.","00:19:21,300","00:19:33,311",True
"7971","6","13","Raj","If it's an alternate dimension... sounds like a job for a landing party.","00:19:34,513","00:19:40,285",True
"7972","6","13","Leonard","Fine, but set them to stun. If we vaporize Penny, I'll never find a girlfriend that pretty again.","00:20:01,424","00:20:06,344",True
"7973","6","13","GPS","Say, can you name the four state capitols that are not served by the interstate system?","00:20:35,085","00:20:40,388",False

"7975","6","14","Raj","What do you think, Sheldon? Want an action figure that looks just like you?","00:00:50,860","00:00:54,162",False
"7976","6","14","Sheldon","So they asked you to pack up your things and ship out. That's hard cheese, Barry. You're one of the good ones.","00:02:21,128","00:02:26,898",True
"7977","6","14","Leonard","Kind of a strange place to put a picture of you and Bernadette.","00:02:46,737","00:02:49,487",False
"7978","6","14","Howard","Well, I wanted everybody to know I love my wife. And nobody to know I forgot to turn off the laser.","00:02:49,489","00:02:57,812",False
"7979","6","14","Leonard","Maybe Wesley Snipes and Toucan Sam just got action figures that look like you guys.","00:03:48,298","00:03:52,033",False
"7980","6","14","Leonard","Aw, and my girlfriend wouldn't let me get one. Look at my face. Do I look smug? I feel smug.","00:03:57,391","00:04:06,214",True

"7985","6","14","Sheldon","There is ominous music playing, and there is an afghan over my head. I don't know where you're from, but where I'm from, that means I'm not doing okay.","00:04:53,179","00:05:00,952",True
"7986","6","14","Sheldon","See, I did all this great work, and now he's just going to come along and ruin it. I am angrier than ever and filled with despair.","00:05:26,829","00:05:32,734",False
"7987","6","14","Leonard","Oh... no, no, no, I know this. Uh... hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks?","00:05:35,155","00:05:40,575",True
"7988","6","14","Sheldon","And yet, now you're in my office. Point: Cooper. Welcome to the Thunderdome, Kripke.","00:05:53,323","00:06:00,512",True

"8002","6","14","Leonard","Sheldon, Kripke's not smarter than you. You just got stuck on a wrong path. Happened to Einstein. He got stuck on the unified field theory for decades.","00:10:24,289","00:10:32,412",True
"8003","6","14","Sheldon","Oh, don't play the Einstein card. His great breakthroughs happened when no one knew anything. So everything was a great breakthrough.","00:10:32,414","00:10:39,135",False
"8004","6","14","Leonard","How did I do that? I got to remember how I did that.","00:10:54,051","00:10:58,187",True
"8005","6","14","Howard","Do you realize, by owning a 3-D printer, we are reclaiming the manufacturing process and taking jobs back from sweatshops in China?","00:10:59,273","00:11:08,498",False
"8006","6","14","Howard","You realize these things go for 25 cents a pop at a party store.","00:11:26,718","00:11:29,919",False

"8013","6","14","Sheldon","I'll do what I can. But it's not going to be easy, because when I'm with Amy and our bathing suit areas mush together... boy howdy, is it magic","00:13:14,826","00:13:26,135",False
"8014","6","14","Bernadette","$5,000 for a couple of dolls? Are you out of your mind?","00:14:16,971","00:14:21,590",False

"8017","6","14","Howard","Yes, but we're married now. That means, when you get sick, I take care of you. And when you make a bunch of money, I get to buy stuff. Sorry if you don't like it, but that's how love works.","00:14:52,456","00:15:11,324",False
"8018","6","14","Bernadette","No, here's how love works. You're gonna return the machine, or you can print out a working set of lady parts and sleep with those.","00:15:11,326","00:15:19,315",False

"8023","6","14","Penny","All right, come on, be serious. Look, you guys have been going out a long time. She would clearly like to have a physical relationship with you, so what are you doing?","00:16:26,618","00:16:35,358",True
"8024","6","14","Sheldon","Well, first of all, I'm quite fond of Amy.","00:16:38,529","00:16:42,198",False
"8025","6","14","Sheldon","all my life, I have been uncomfortable with the sort of physical contact that comes easily to others-- hand-shaking, hugging, prostate exams. But I'm working on it, you know? Just recently, I had to put VapoRub on Amy's chest. A year ago, that would have been unthinkable.","00:16:45,853","00:17:10,643",False

"8033","6","15","Leonard","I don't know why I avoided the Harry Potter books for so long. These are great. I just started number six.","00:00:02,630","00:00:08,886",False

"8036","6","15","Sheldon","Yes, and I have a theory why. Because of your lactose intolerance, you switched over to soy milk. Soy contains estrogen-mimicking compounds. I think your morning Cocoa Puffs are turning you into a hysterical woman.","00:00:43,155","00:00:58,552",True

"8042","6","15","Howard","No, just me, her and a couple of the big wigs. It's part of a bonus she got.","00:03:14,334","00:03:18,854",False

"8065","6","15","Sheldon","Oh, it took me forever to get him on a bathroom schedule. He would just go whenever the mood struck him.","00:09:24,237","00:09:32,043",True

"8094","6","15","Sheldon","She doesn't want to live with Leonard, so he has to come live here again. She's the snake in our garden. She's the reason we can't be happy.","00:18:33,959","00:18:42,382",True

"8130","6","16","Bernadette","I've been working late every night. All I asked was that he clean the apartment and do one load of laundry. But did he do it?

That's where I fell in love with astronomy, and now I'm an astrophysicist at Caltech, so I guess you could say, uh, Raj is my name and stars are my game. And rhyming is also my game. So, uh, two games. Uh, anyway, that-that's enough about me. I want to hear everything about you.","00:00:52,120","00:01:22,066",False

"8240","6","18","Amy","Well, evolutionary biology says that women are attracted to a man who is steady in the face of danger, so I recommend an unsafe environment. Seedy bar on the wrong side of the tracks... picnic near a lunatic asylum... a wine tasting on Skid Row.","00:04:57,450","00:05:17,351",True

"8253","6","18","Amy","Oh, I was very clever, I did it in stages. At 7:00 last night, I called about a problem at the lab and casually mentioned I was going out for seafood. At 9:30, I called and told him that one of my scallops tasted weird. At 11:30, I called and said I was throwing up like a fire hose.","00:08:06,472","00:08:23,404",True

"8292","6","19","Bernadette","Told you you shouldn't have espresso after dinner. I know the little cups make you feel big, but it's not worth it.","00:05:39,395","00:05:46,651",False
"8293","6","19","Bernadette","Why don't you read it? Maybe he apologizes or explains why he left.","00:06:05,388","00:06:10,057",False

"8305","6","19","Sheldon","Control over the information contained in that letter belongs to Howard. By happenstance, I came to know it. That doesn't give me the right to disseminate it freely.","00:08:53,339","00:09:02,212",False
"8306","6","19","Penny","Come on. Look, the letter was found in Bernadette's closet. Doesn't that count for something?","00:09:02,214","00:09:05,850",False

"8312","6","19","Sheldon","Sorry, badgering me won't work. What you should have said is, ""It's pointless to keep this a secret because Penny will tell us.""","00:10:57,880","00:11:03,517",True

"8319","6","19","Howard","That's nice. I got to tell you, as angry as I am at Sheldon for blabbing, he did a hell of a job organizing this closet. Look at this. ""Photos of Wolowitz family before father left forever.""","00:13:19,111","00:13:33,540",True

"8327","6","19","Penny","It was a letter explaining that your dad wasn't who he said he was. Eventually, his other life caught up to him, and the only way to keep you and your mom safe was to leave.","00:16:16,204","00:16:25,528",False

"8342","6","20","Sheldon","Excuse me, the whole tenure system is ridiculous. A guaranteed job for life only encourages the faculty to become complacent.

"8366","6","20","Sheldon","Because you want to start watching it right now. Copy that. Let's see. Up next on the tenure committee is... Professor Wu. Well, get ready for the complete works of Jackie Chan.","00:10:22,518","00:10:38,765",True

"8407","6","21","Sheldon","Oh, sure, what a wonderful idea. And after that, I'll make up my own rules of oral hygiene. You know, instead of flossing, I'll rub pudding on my gums. I'm going to get the number of the SyFy Channel and give them what for.","00:01:24,599","00:01:36,776",False
"8408","6","21","Sheldon","No. They can't just cancel a show like <i>Alphas.</i> You know?

"8416","6","21","Raj","No, no, I don't know if I should. If she wanted me to know about her blog, she would've told me. It's almost like I'm reading her diary.","00:03:41,069","00:03:46,739",False
"8417","6","21","Howard","Oh, I think we were looking at creepy in the rearview mirror when I put up that camera.","00:03:51,546","00:03:56,916",True

"8419","6","21","Sheldon","I am not flying back to Texas just so my mom can give me a hug.","00:05:40,821","00:05:45,291",True
"8420","6","21","Amy","Well, what I think is going on here is you have a pathological need for closure.","00:05:47,996","00:05:53,082",False
"8421","6","21","Amy","You know, I might be able to help you with this. There's a whole field of behavioral neuroscience that examines ways to retrain your neural pathways so stuff like this bothers you less.","00:06:01,258","00:06:11,217",False
"8422","6","21","Sheldon","Yeah, but I just told you, I don't have a problem with closure.","00:06:11,219","00:06:14,187",False

"8426","6","21","Howard","her giving me the key to her heart? ""The key to her heart."" That's nice. Were you quoting someone or is it tattooed on the small of your back?","00:07:24,592","00:07:33,415",True
"8427","6","21","Leonard","So, did you love it? Of course you loved it. How could you not love it? Tell me how much you loved it.","00:07:48,098","00:07:53,653",True
"8428","6","21","Penny","So you want me to stop calling your little tushy cute?","00:08:05,083","00:08:08,551",False

"8434","6","21","Sheldon","The same way any normal person would. Feel like I want to peel off my own face and tear it in two and then again and again until I have a handful of Sheldon-face confetti.","00:10:19,933","00:10:28,607",True
"8435","6","21","Amy","And that's exactly the feeling we want to address with this course of treatment.","00:10:29,860","00:10:32,895",False
"8436","6","21","Sheldon","Yeah, or you could pitch in, grab a nostril and help me get this face off.","00:10:32,897","00:10:36,949",False

"8438","6","21","Bernadette","Well, there was action, it was funny. I mean, you do get that usually the monster chases the pretty girl, but this time the pretty girl chases the monsters?","00:11:15,878","00:11:25,403",True
"8439","6","21","Bernadette","Well, sure. I'm pretty passionate about science. I remember the first time I looked through a microscope and saw millions of tiny microorganisms. It was like a whole other universe. If I wanted to, I could wipe it out with my thumb like a god.","00:11:39,819","00:11:54,665",True
"8440","6","21","Penny","See? I wish I had some of that fire in my life. I mean, I want to care about things and get excited like you guys.","00:11:55,884","00:12:02,123",False

"8449","6","21","Raj","Probably because I didn't read the instructions. No wrapper's going to tell me what to do. Unless his name is Jay-Z.","00:14:38,364","00:14:46,003",False
"8450","6","21","Lucy","Well, you're acting all weird. And I'm pretty weird, so I think I know what I'm talking about.","00:14:48,858","00:14:54,628",True

"8456","6","21","Lucy","Raj, I didn't say ""feminine"" was a bad thing. I meant that you're sweet and thoughtful and your skin looks so much like caramel, I just want to dip an apple in your face.","00:15:41,677","00:15:51,301",True
"8457","6","21","Raj","Bought this at the Staples Center when I went to see Taylor Swift.","00:16:04,834","00:16:07,868",True

"8463","6","21","Sheldon","Amy, I must say, I was skeptical at first, but this has truly been a transformative evening.","00:17:29,167","00:17:35,589",False

"8469","6","22","Penny","Aw, so cute when you use the word ""cool"" wrong. Like when kids say ""pasghetti.""","00:00:56,340","00:01:03,428",True
"8470","6","22","Leonard","It would be pretty awesome to hang out with him. I just used ""awesome"" wrong, didn't I?","00:01:19,979","00:01:24,282",True

"8486","6","22","Bernadette","You know, there were a few moments today when I almost felt like we were a little family.","00:06:02,921","00:06:07,308",False
"8487","6","22","Bernadette","I never thought of myself as a mom, but when the three of us were out there having fun, I felt like maybe someday we could do it.","00:06:08,811","00:06:14,098",False
"8488","6","22","Sheldon","Professor Proton was never late when he was on TV. You know, every day, 4:00, he was there. Unless tornadoes were ripping apart East Texas, in which case, we'd join him in progress. (cell phone ringing) It's him.","00:06:50,787","00:07:07,618",True

"8517","7","1","Sheldon","Everything I say is true. Now, of course, the dung beetle also enjoys eating feces, living in feces and making little balls out of feces. So... pick and choose which aspects of its lifestyle you want to embrace.","00:03:10,910","00:03:25,866",True

"8543","7","1","Raj","You know, I recently read a fascinating article on infidelity among penguins.","00:07:09,027","00:07:13,610",False
"8544","7","1","Raj","So if the fact that your husband left you makes you feel unattractive, just remember, penguins get cheated on, and they're adorable.","00:07:16,731","00:07:24,544",False
"8545","7","1","Howard","It was better when you couldn't talk to women.","00:07:37,065","00:07:39,784",True

"8547","7","1","Amy","Oh, brain lesions are fascinating. Unless they're yours, then they're a drag.","00:07:48,377","00:07:53,082",False
"8548","7","1","Amy","And to the sick and dying who make it possible.","00:07:56,344","00:07:59,266",False
"8549","7","1","Bernadette","This is fun; we never really get to talk shop with Penny around. We usually just end up talking about boys.","00:08:01,347","00:08:06,256",False
"8550","7","1","Amy","Which is fine, but it's nice to mix it up with a little intellectual conversation.","00:08:06,356","00:08:10,781",False
"8551","7","1","Amy","Oh, my gosh, boys bought us drinks! Boys bought us drinks! Thank you, thank you, thank you so much.","00:08:12,974","00:08:19,403",True

"8555","7","1","Penny","Gosh, I wonder what Leonard's doing right now. I miss him so much.","00:09:07,594","00:09:11,075",False
"8556","7","1","Sheldon","Well, if you'd like, we could call him. I-I mean that you could call him. As I've explained, the absence of my friends does not cause me pain. As rock and roll bad boy, Paul Simon, once said, ""I am a rock. I am an i-i-i-island.""","00:09:11,169","00:09:25,738",False
"8557","7","1","Leonard","Excuse me, ladies, but my pants are buzzing.","00:09:38,934","00:09:41,838",False

"8561","7","1","Leonard","- No, it's a drinking game. Whenever we see an iceberg, we take a shot!","00:10:19,385","00:10:25,005",False
"8562","7","1","Bernadette","It's fine. I thanked them again and let them know we're not available.","00:10:45,671","00:10:48,970",False
"8563","7","1","Amy","So I can drink this without having to give up the goodies?","00:10:48,994","00:10:52,419",False

"8566","7","1","Amy","No, tell me, I want to know what you meant by that.","00:11:19,369","00:11:22,455",True
"8567","7","1","Bernadette","I just meant that you're not married and your boyfriend's kind of...","00:11:24,210","00:11:28,496",False
"8568","7","1","Amy","And your husband is extremely Howard. What's your point?","00:11:31,678","00:11:35,443",False
"8569","7","1","Bernadette","Sorry. I have no point. That was a stupid thing to say. Can we please just go back to having a nice time?","00:11:37,310","00:11:43,262",True
"8570","7","1","Amy","We could, but unfortunately my brain is lesion-free and I remember that rotten thing you just said about my sweet baboo.","00:11:43,285","00:11:50,252",False
"8571","7","1","Bernadette","Come on. I apologize. Can we please just let it go?","00:11:50,685","00:11:53,722",False
"8572","7","1","Sheldon","That you're having to process your emotional pain without vodka?","00:12:09,591","00:12:13,380",False
"8573","7","1","Sheldon","Allow me to comfort you. At least you've got your health.","00:12:27,573","00:12:33,011",False

"8576","7","1","Sheldon","Oh, no, I don't think that's true at all.","00:12:53,808","00:12:56,173",False
"8577","7","1","Sheldon","perhaps you're obsessively picturing him engaged in drunken coitus with another woman.","00:13:04,067","00:13:10,765",False
"8578","7","1","Sheldon","Is that it? Did I get it right?","00:13:14,142","00:13:16,597",False
"8579","7","1","Sheldon","Actually, I can't. Before Leonard left, he made me promise that I'd take care of you.","00:13:22,118","00:13:27,352",True
"8580","7","1","Sheldon","Plus, if I do a good job, he said he'd bring me back a sailor's cap.","00:13:31,871","00:13:36,042",False

"8586","7","1","Sheldon","But I don't want to know how many underpants you own. Although, based on the floor of your bedroom, I'd say it's a thousand.","00:15:23,135","00:15:29,618",False
"8587","7","1","Sheldon","And it was literally the moment you walked out the door.","00:15:57,857","00:16:01,336",True
"8588","7","1","Sheldon","But I see the type of personal revelations you're going for. Okay, here's one I thought I'd take to the grave.","00:16:03,337","00:16:10,898",False
"8589","7","1","Penny","Okay, you know what? I give up. I'm going to bed.","00:16:41,850","00:16:45,434",True
"8590","7","1","Sheldon","Here's something else you don't know about me: you just hurt my feelings.","00:16:46,583","00:16:50,841",False
"8591","7","1","Sheldon","I opened up and shared something deeply upsetting to me, and you treated it as if it were nothing.","00:16:52,347","00:16:57,864",False
"8592","7","1","Sheldon","Now I know how you felt getting mauled by that sex-crazed gorilla.","00:17:22,409","00:17:26,652",True
"8593","7","1","Amy","It was rather flattering to have strangers send us drinks.","00:17:52,347","00:17:55,448",False
"8594","7","1","Amy","I think I would have gone with the short one with the goofy haircut.","00:18:16,567","00:18:19,129",False
"8595","7","1","Bernadette","Oh, good, 'cause I liked the tall thin one. He seemed intelligent, kind of a loner, maybe a little sexually inexperienced, like I'd have to teach him a thing or two.","00:18:19,173","00:18:29,058",False
"8596","7","1","Bernadette","Your short sexed-up guy kind of sounds like Howard.","00:18:46,363","00:18:49,422",False

"8598","7","1","Raj","No, no, no, that would be crazy! I mean, if I were hitting on you, you'd know it 'cause you'd feel uncomfortable and a little sad for me.","00:19:31,866","00:19:39,030",False
"8599","7","1","Raj","And then some. I think we had a moment.","00:19:53,144","00:19:56,657",False
"8600","7","1","Howard","But even if there was, what are you gonna do about it?","00:20:09,342","00:20:12,848",False
"8601","7","1","Raj","I will slowly seduce her until she falls helpless into my bed, hungry for the pleasure only I can give her.","00:20:13,448","00:20:20,539",False
"8602","7","1","Penny","I'm so glad the police finally caught that psychotic genetically engineered ape.","00:20:28,818","00:20:34,930",False
"8603","7","2","Sheldon","Changes in jet streams can affect the speed at which the Earth rotates on its axis, so bad weather can actually make the day longer.","00:00:07,954","00:00:17,202",False
"8604","7","2","Penny","Well, there must be a hell of a storm somewhere.","00:00:17,302","00:00:20,170",True
"8605","7","2","Sheldon","Joke if you must, but you're going to miss these moments. With Leonard home in a few days, this was your last time driving me to the grocery store.","00:00:22,213","00:00:30,575",False
"8606","7","2","Sheldon","I'll tell you what, if my apples are mealy, we'll hit the produce section for one last crazy blowout. Heck, you can even push the cart. Please don't take my looking forward to Leonard's return as criticism of the job you've been doing in his absence.","00:00:32,906","00:00:50,732",False
"8607","7","2","Sheldon","That criticism will come later in your report card.","00:00:52,323","00:00:55,760",True
"8608","7","2","Penny","Yeah, I didn't stay for the detention, I'm not gonna read the report card.","00:00:56,442","00:01:00,776",True
"8609","7","2","Leonard","We finished the experiment early, so I thought I'd come home and surprise you.","00:01:10,189","00:01:12,923",False
"8610","7","2","Leonard","I didn't tell Sheldon, so we could have a few days alone.","00:01:14,403","00:01:17,016",False

"8615","7","2","Sheldon","Anyhoo... Leonard will be back in a couple days and I need a welcome-home gift for him. As he's been at sea, perhaps something with a nautical theme might be appropriate.","00:02:11,129","00:02:22,056",False
"8616","7","2","Stuart","Okay, well, I don't know how much you want to spend, but I do have this pretty cool Aquaman statue.","00:02:22,152","00:02:27,694",False
"8617","7","2","Stuart","Yeah, just as well. It's a pretty rare piece. I'd rather just sell it to a real collector.","00:02:37,381","00:02:42,482",False
"8618","7","2","Stuart","Oh, I shouldn't even have mentioned it. How about a Batman squirt gun?","00:02:47,700","00:02:51,615",False
"8619","7","2","Howard","What were they thinking, putting Doctor Octopus's mind in Spider-Man's body?","00:02:59,033","00:03:04,175",False
"8620","7","2","Raj","Well, I've been quite enjoying that. It combines all the superhero fun of Spider-Man with all the body-switching shenanigans of <i>Freaky Friday.</i> Both versions: original and Lohan.","00:03:04,206","00:03:14,591",True
"8621","7","2","Howard","I'm sorry, I've been kind of snippy lately. It's probably this stupid diet I'm on.","00:03:21,478","00:03:25,631",False
"8622","7","2","Howard","I've put on a couple pounds. Had to buy these pants in the men's section.","00:03:26,771","00:03:32,602",True
"8623","7","2","Raj","Well, we've all seen your mom. That Butterball turkey was bound to come home to roost.","00:03:34,980","00:03:41,451",True
"8624","7","2","Stuart","All right, Sheldon, you win. I'm sure Leonard is gonna love this.","00:03:46,757","00:03:50,848",True
"8625","7","2","Sheldon","Oh, right, a present for Leonard. You better throw in that squirt gun.","00:03:50,915","00:03:56,891",True
"8626","7","2","Stuart","Yeah, I don't know. This squirt gun, it's, uh, it's pretty rare.","00:03:57,891","00:04:01,571",True
"8627","7","2","Leonard","And this is me doing the <i>Titanic</i> pose on the boat.","00:04:06,718","00:04:10,139",False
"8628","7","2","Leonard","And I'm gonna hit the head. That's what us salty sea dogs say when we have to go pee-pee.","00:04:21,675","00:04:27,025",False
"8629","7","2","Pizza","Seriously? I just walked up, like, four flights of stairs.","00:04:32,734","00:04:36,189",False
"8630","7","2","Penny","Oh. Okay. Well, here's, um... 30-something cents and a promise I won't call your boss and tell him you reek of marijuana.","00:04:37,333","00:04:46,987",True
"8631","7","2","Sheldon","Oh, that's a rather earthy cologne. My uncle used to wear that. Perhaps we can enjoy one last meal together before Leonard returns.","00:04:54,431","00:05:06,872",True
"8632","7","2","Penny","Yeah, thanks, but I kind of feel like eating alone tonight, so...","00:05:06,903","00:05:09,016",False

"8634","7","2","Sheldon","I'm quite familiar with plumbing. Not to brag, but I spent most of fifth grade with my head in a toilet.","00:05:36,012","00:05:42,519",False
"8635","7","2","Penny","Yeah, no, no, no. You know what, Sheldon, it's okay. You don't have to go into the bathroom.","00:05:43,163","00:05:47,148",False
"8636","7","2","Penny","Okay. Look, honey, I promise there's no one's here. I've had a long day. I just want to have a quiet dinner by myself.","00:06:15,274","00:06:20,040",False

"8639","7","2","Howard","I had to rub her ointment all over her again.","00:07:05,439","00:07:08,033",False
"8640","7","2","Howard","'Cause we've got a deeply unhealthy relationship. Which reminds me, do you think you can get any samples of this from work? This was supposed to last her a month, but they didn't take into account the square footage of her back.","00:07:09,815","00:07:22,702",False
"8641","7","2","Bernadette","This is really strong estrogen cream. Please tell me you've been wearing gloves.","00:07:31,807","00:07:35,808",False
"8642","7","2","Bernadette","Howie, the estrogen's getting absorbed by your skin. That's why you've been all bloated and moody and a giant pain in the ass.","00:07:40,053","00:07:47,746",False
"8643","7","2","Howard","You're full of estrogen and you don't act like that.","00:07:48,869","00:07:50,969",True

"8646","7","2","Bernadette","It's okay. You still look great to me. In fact, why don't we go in the bedroom and I'll prove it to you?","00:08:08,470","00:08:15,572",False
"8647","7","2","Howard","Sex? Really? I mean, that's just your solution to everything!","00:08:16,113","00:08:19,569",False
"8648","7","2","Amy","Oh, and here's a fun thing. I worked it out so that there are two different words for spoon: ""planko"" and ""janko."" ""Planko"" is a spoon with food, ""janko"" is a spoon without food. ""Janko"" is spelled with a silent ""ptang.""","00:08:22,254","00:08:38,087",True
"8649","7","2","Amy","Sheldon, you're not even listening to the rules of my made-up language.","00:08:40,254","00:08:44,445",False
"8650","7","2","Sheldon","I'm sorry. I'm just distracted by something that happened over at Penny's.","00:08:55,452","00:08:59,919",False
"8651","7","2","Sheldon","She claimed to be alone when there was obviously someone else in her apartment. I have no choice but to assume the worst, given Leonard's lengthy sea voyage and her famously ravenous nether regions.","00:09:05,108","00:09:18,087",False
"8652","7","2","Sheldon","Why would Leonard come home early and waste his time kissing Penny when he could be hanging out with his best buddy? Yeah, that's it. I'm catching her in the act.","00:10:20,053","00:10:31,415",False
"8653","7","2","Penny","Sheldon, you cannot just barge in here like that!","00:10:37,314","00:10:39,673",True

"8655","7","2","Sheldon","Oh, no, I should apologize. Uh, I never realized to what extent our friendship was a burden to you.","00:11:04,103","00:11:10,244",False
"8656","7","2","Sheldon","Oh, no, no, let's not sugarcoat this. You find me finicky, pedantic and annoying.","00:11:15,307","00:11:20,699",False
"8657","7","2","Sheldon","Well, Leonard, I think it's high time you and I address the ""tweepadock"" in the room.","00:11:29,445","00:11:34,497",False
"8658","7","2","Sheldon","No, no, you save your apologies for after you've had disappointing coitus with Penny.","00:11:45,656","00:11:50,595",False

"8660","7","2","Howard","Yeah, that's cucumber and cream cheese. That's turkey and loganberry. And don't tell my hips, but I'm warming up a brie in the oven.","00:12:54,058","00:13:02,020",True
"8661","7","2","Howard","Okay, well, I've been reading up on all the side effects you can get from estrogen, and... I need you to be honest with me. Do my boobs look bigger to you?","00:13:06,557","00:13:18,339",False
"8662","7","2","Howard","Come on, Raj, it's a ""yes or no"" question.","00:13:21,777","00:13:23,890",False
"8664","7","2","Leonard","So am I driving you to work or are you still mad at me?","00:15:13,371","00:15:16,229",False
"8665","7","2","Leonard","I'm going to work. You can come if you want.","00:15:44,541","00:15:46,766",False
"8666","7","2","Sheldon","By the way, you have something on your shirt.","00:15:49,227","00:15:52,299",False
"8667","7","2","Leonard","I didn't make it back. The ship sank, I'm in hell.","00:16:05,323","00:16:08,531",False
"8668","7","2","Sheldon","You say you're from New Jersey, but how can I believe you?","00:16:11,035","00:16:14,924",True
"8669","7","2","Leonard","Why would anyone claim to be from New Jersey if they weren't?","00:16:15,556","00:16:19,174",False
"8670","7","2","Leonard","Hey, I said I was sorry. What else do you want from me?","00:16:24,804","00:16:27,640",True
"8671","7","2","Sheldon","I want you to admit that what you did was wrong.","00:16:27,666","00:16:30,044",True
"8672","7","2","Sheldon","You say one thing and do the other, so then you are driving me and you find me a delight.","00:16:40,493","00:16:46,333",False
"8673","7","2","Sheldon","So I guess you're really holding up the other four fingers?","00:16:56,138","00:16:59,444",True
"8674","7","2","Penny","Oh, hey, what are you doing here so early?","00:17:03,159","00:17:04,683",False
"8675","7","2","Amy","- Well, he's mad at you, too. He says you're the succubus who led his friend astray.","00:17:06,107","00:17:12,382",False
"8676","7","2","Penny","I don't know what ""succubus"" is, but... it has ""suck"" in it, so that can't be good.","00:17:14,489","00:17:19,926",True
"8678","7","2","Penny","Come on, don't be like that. We had so much fun together the last couple of months.","00:17:28,325","00:17:31,896",False
"8679","7","2","Sheldon","I let you buy feminine hygiene products with my supermarket club card. You have any idea the kind of coupons I'm going to get in the mail now?","00:17:35,916","00:17:45,180",False
"8680","7","2","Amy","Sheldon, your fight's with Leonard. Penny's got nothing to do...","00:17:46,317","00:17:48,927",True
"8681","7","2","Amy","FYI, I had a doughnut for breakfast, you jerk.","00:18:06,262","00:18:09,557",True
"8682","7","2","Leonard","So now we're just waiting for the data from the ship to be crunched, but the numbers look pretty promising.","00:18:12,767","00:18:18,100",True
"8683","7","2","Sheldon","A crazy person with a long memory, and if all goes according to plan, a robot army.","00:18:33,468","00:18:38,982",True
"8684","7","2","Sheldon","- Stop it. - Or a mutant army. It depends on how my Kickstarter goes.","00:18:39,885","00:18:44,313",False
"8685","7","2","Howard","So, can we please put aside these petty differences and just be glad we're here together?","00:19:28,164","00:19:35,375",False
"8686","7","2","Raj","Uh, it wasn't anything weird. It was just to see how big they were.","00:19:42,767","00:19:46,369",False
"8687","7","2","Sheldon","And then Leonard took me to the barber and the dentist, and then to cap off the perfect day, the Los Angeles Bureau of Weights and Measures.","00:19:51,885","00:20:00,096",False
"8688","7","2","Leonard","I thought the measures were going to be the stars of the show; turns out it was the weights.","00:20:01,164","00:20:06,278",False
"8689","7","2","Sheldon","And I'm glad you and I are friends again, too.","00:20:09,813","00:20:12,487",True
"8690","7","2","Raj","Uh, can I just say, I've missed all of us hanging out together.","00:20:26,933","00:20:30,608",True
"8691","7","3","Raj","couldn't help but notice none of you RSVP'd to my murder mystery dinner party.","00:00:04,143","00:00:08,879",False
"8692","7","3","Raj","No, you weren't because it was a week ago and nobody came! So, if you want to solve the mystery of who stabbed Koothrappali in the back with the weapon of indifference, it was all of you.","00:00:12,318","00:00:22,827",True
"8693","7","3","Sheldon","I don't think that qualifies as a mystery. We all knew what we were doing.","00:00:22,829","00:00:27,348",True
"8694","7","3","Raj","Don't worry, I can take a hint. No more murder mystery parties.","00:00:34,474","00:00:38,459",False
"8695","7","3","Sheldon","That's amusing-- I was going to say that about M.I.T., but it works for Princeton, too.","00:00:57,829","00:01:02,450",True
"8696","7","3","Amy","Scavenger hunts at Harvard were really tough. I always got stuck on the first challenge-- trying to find someone to be on a team with me.","00:01:03,985","00:01:09,557",True
"8697","7","3","Amy","I guess that story's more sad than funny.","00:01:11,844","00:01:14,862",True
"8698","7","3","Leonard","Oh, these are a little different. There's a tradition at elite universities.","00:01:19,268","00:01:22,970",True
"8699","7","3","Penny","Oh, in ours we would just run around town looking for a store that would sell us beer.","00:01:31,680","00:01:36,150",True
"8700","7","3","Sheldon","I'm sorry. Are we really doing this or are we tricking Koothrappali again like with the dinner party?","00:01:42,741","00:01:47,995",True
"8701","7","3","Sheldon","Oh, everything I could possibly need to win the scavenger hunt.","00:02:19,330","00:02:24,383",False

"8703","7","3","Howard","Yes, to be fair, do people who went to Princeton get a head start?","00:03:50,837","00:03:54,957",True
"8704","7","3","Sheldon","Oh, it actually is if you get the joke. It's based on the premise that Princeton isn't a very good school.","00:03:56,477","00:04:03,399",True
"8705","7","3","Sheldon","The only time I'm ever picked first for a team and I'm stuck with the liability?","00:04:47,728","00:04:52,031",True
"8706","7","3","Sheldon","It's not hard-- one in five. Now you know why I'm pouting.","00:05:19,644","00:05:23,812",True
"8707","7","3","Sheldon","What are you doing? You have to start with the edges.","00:05:43,917","00:05:46,785",False
"8708","7","3","Penny","Well, there's no right way, Sheldon. I already found a few pieces that fit.","00:05:46,787","00:05:49,505",False
"8709","7","3","Amy","I did them all the time as a kid. As my mom used to say, ""When you're doing a puzzle, it's like having a thousand friends.""","00:06:00,017","00:06:07,539",True
"8710","7","3","Amy","She was full of fun lies like that.","00:06:09,059","00:06:11,610",True
"8711","7","3","Howard","If it makes you feel any better, my mom's just full of pound cake.","00:06:11,612","00:06:15,948",True
"8712","7","3","Amy","I'm sorry you got stuck with me. I bet you wanted to be with Bernadette.","00:06:15,950","00:06:19,818",False
"8713","7","3","Penny","Ooh, ooh, it's the comic book store! All right, come on. That's where we have to go.","00:06:38,706","00:06:42,541",False
"8714","7","3","Sheldon","Come on. You think you know the answer. But it could be a trick. What if when the puzzle's complete, there's a sign in the window that says, ""Go to the train store""?","00:06:47,565","00:06:57,072",True
"8715","7","3","Bernadette","Come on, numb nuts, it's the comic book store!","00:07:07,702","00:07:09,952",True
"8717","7","3","Bernadette","Because you're in the right lane behind a bus and you won't go around it? I'm sure she finds it charming.","00:07:40,868","00:07:46,538",True
"8718","7","3","Leonard","No, because I didn't want her on my team.","00:07:46,540","00:07:49,441",False
"8719","7","3","Bernadette","I'm starting to think she dodged a bullet. The slowest bullet in the world.","00:07:49,443","00:07:54,079",True
"8720","7","3","Amy","Well, off the top of my head, I'd say we don't have a lot in common except for the people we're involved with. Plus, when we first met, Penny warned me never to get into a car alone with you.","00:08:21,525","00:08:31,834",False
"8721","7","3","Howard","You know, I bet you and I have more in common than we think.","00:08:36,172","00:08:39,758",False
"8722","7","3","Amy","Sheldon never lets me listen to music in the car. He doesn't want to be mistaken for a gang member.","00:08:55,709","00:09:00,479",True
"8723","7","3","Raj","Oh, hey, thanks for letting me use the comic book store as part of the scavenger hunt.","00:09:40,954","00:09:44,255",False
"8724","7","3","Amy","Yes! It's not a ruse to make fun of me. It's a real game and I'm winning it!","00:09:54,050","00:10:00,187",True
"8725","7","3","Leonard","Hey, Penny, I just wanted to say good luck, and I hope there's no hard feelings.","00:11:02,035","00:11:05,953",True
"8726","7","3","Leonard","Relax, it's a hard puzzle. It's gonna take a while to solve.","00:11:10,892","00:11:14,295",True
"8727","7","3","Penny","Hey, Princeton, look at that, Team Community College Night School is in the lead.","00:11:17,549","00:11:21,301",True
"8728","7","3","Sheldon","The next clue must be hidden under one of these rocks.","00:12:13,956","00:12:16,373",False
"8729","7","3","Leonard","Um, I'm okay with you driving my car. I'm not okay with you flying my car.","00:14:05,016","00:14:10,988",True
"8730","7","3","Bernadette","Don't sweat it, my dad's a cop. He can fix things.","00:14:10,990","00:14:13,107",False
"8731","7","3","Leonard","This stupid game is why she's mad in the first place. I'm telling her I'm quitting.","00:14:27,590","00:14:31,258",False
"8732","7","3","Bernadette","Because it would make you seem like something she already thinks you are.","00:14:35,664","00:14:38,999",False
"8733","7","3","Bernadette","How do I put this? She's been known to call you a name that usually applies to a lady part.","00:14:41,003","00:14:48,976",False
"8735","7","3","Leonard","I can't believe she would say that about me.","00:14:59,070","00:15:01,472",False
"8736","7","3","Penny","Three bags, no one's opened 'em. We're the first ones here!","00:16:42,257","00:16:45,392",False
"8737","7","3","Penny","You know, I'm surprised you want to copy my answers since I'm not even smart enough to be on your team.","00:17:07,500","00:17:12,169",False
"8738","7","3","Leonard","Well, why would you want to be on someone's team who you like to call a... I can't even say it in front of Sheldon.","00:17:12,171","00:17:18,158",True
"8739","7","3","Penny","Yeah, well, you should have quit 'cause I'm still gonna beat your ass.","00:17:35,611","00:17:38,112",False
"8740","7","3","Bernadette","Wish I had a man like her on my team.","00:17:38,114","00:17:40,314",True
"8741","7","3","Sheldon","No, no, that's not mine. That has a big spot on it.","00:17:52,211","00:17:54,962",False
"8742","7","3","Sheldon","Be there in a minute. I just have to pre-soak these!","00:18:10,846","00:18:13,847",True
"8743","7","3","Raj","Okay, okay, that-that came out wrong, but you have to admit, you all had a wonderful time.","00:19:38,384","00:19:44,288",False

"8746","7","4","Amy","I enjoyed it. When you told me I was going to be ""losing my virginity,"" I didn't think you meant showing me <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i> for the first time.","00:00:15,780","00:00:23,458",False
"8747","7","4","Sheldon","My apologies. I chose my words poorly. I should have said you were about to have your world rocked on my couch.","00:00:23,978","00:00:31,375",True
"8748","7","4","Sheldon","Anyway, thank you for watching it. It's one of my all-time favorites.","00:00:33,400","00:00:37,831",False
"8749","7","4","Amy","It was very entertaining... despite the glaring story problem.","00:00:37,895","00:00:42,302",True
"8750","7","4","Sheldon","Oh, I see your confusion. You don't understand. Indiana Jones was the one in the hat with the whip.","00:01:25,748","00:01:33,118",True
"8751","7","4","Amy","No, I do, and if he weren't in the movie, the Nazis would have still found the ark, taken it to the island, opened it up and all died... just like they did.","00:01:34,223","00:01:44,222",True
"8753","7","4","Penny","Hi! I thought you went to the comic book store on Wednesdays.","00:02:20,119","00:02:22,821",False
"8754","7","4","Penny","- Oh, good. Check it out. The Disappointing Child by Beverly Hofstadter.","00:02:33,142","00:02:38,902",False
"8755","7","4","Penny","It's on the recommended reading list for my psychology class.","00:02:51,483","00:02:54,289",True
"8756","7","4","Leonard","Come on. Not that book. It-It's got, like, every horrible story from my childhood in it.","00:02:58,132","00:03:05,577",False
"8757","7","4","Penny","Oh, come on. Why? How bad could it be?","00:03:12,122","00:03:14,613",False
"8758","7","4","Leonard","It was not a crisis. Apparently, I favored the left one, she got a little lopsided.","00:03:40,588","00:03:47,411",False
"8759","7","4","Raj","Which celebrity would you say I look like the most?","00:03:56,720","00:03:59,283",False

"8762","7","4","Sheldon","Yeah, except for the fact that Indiana Jones is completely irrelevant to the story. With or without him, the Nazis find the ark, open it and die.","00:04:34,915","00:04:43,256",False
"8763","7","4","Howard","Hey, wait a minute. No, the Nazis were digging in the wrong place. The only reason they got the ark was because Indy found it first.","00:04:51,745","00:04:58,078",False
"8764","7","4","Leonard","Actually, they were only digging in the wrong place because Indy had the medallion. Without him, they would have had the medallion and dug in the right place.","00:04:58,103","00:05:04,610",False
"8765","7","4","Penny","Okay, I know you don't want to talk about it, but can I just ask you one question about your mom's book?","00:05:13,929","00:05:17,971",False
"8766","7","4","Leonard","They weren't boobies, they were muscles. And the makeup was green. I was pretending to be The Hulk.","00:05:28,053","00:05:34,263",True
"8767","7","4","Leonard","to keep my muscles from sagging! Can we please stop talking about this?!","00:05:35,496","00:05:40,056",False
"8768","7","4","Penny","Sweetie, I'm so sorry. I wish there was something - I could do to make you feel better. - I do, too, but there's not.","00:06:16,696","00:06:21,733",False
"8769","7","4","Leonard","Of course, who am I to argue with a check-plus student? Mmm... Just warning you-- I'm gonna go right. Don't make a big deal out of it.","00:06:28,055","00:06:36,044",False
"8770","7","4","Raj","Well, when someone looks at your dating profile, the first thing they see is your picture. I just want to make sure you look fun and full of life and not like a body they just pulled out of the river. All right, here we go, and... smile.","00:06:47,932","00:07:02,959",False
"8771","7","4","Raj","Okay, uh-uh, that one's in the bank. How about this? Turn away, and then turn back into it. But when you do, imagine the camera is the girl you want to meet.","00:07:07,836","00:07:19,454",False
"8772","7","4","Raj","Okay, uh, let's try it again. Uh, but this time, pretend the girl you want to meet doesn't want to hurt you.","00:07:30,490","00:07:38,153",False
"8774","7","4","Raj","Yeah, it's, it's a little blurry, but I think that works in your favor. - Do you want a beer? - Sure.","00:07:53,989","00:08:01,368",True
"8775","7","4","Stuart","Hey, have you finished writing your profile yet?","00:08:01,516","00:08:03,797",False
"8776","7","4","Raj","Oh, what did you put as the one-word description of yourself?","00:08:05,194","00:08:08,429",False
"8777","7","4","Raj","Come on, dude, you're being too hard on yourself. You've got a lot of good stuff going on.","00:08:27,000","00:08:31,059",False

"8780","7","4","Sheldon","Oh, it turns out Amy's beloved <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> is a flawless masterpiece. He's got too much pride, she's got too much prejudice-- it just works.","00:09:00,207","00:09:10,524",True
"8781","7","4","Leonard","So you're looking to ruin something for her in the funny pages?","00:09:11,323","00:09:14,582",True
"8782","7","4","Sheldon","Amy has a fondness for the comic strip <i>Marmaduke.</i>","00:09:14,632","00:09:17,742",False
"8783","7","4","Sheldon","And I think I've got it. Consider: a family possesses a dog that is so large and poorly disciplined, he causes nothing but problems. Why do they keep him?!","00:09:20,249","00:09:32,134",False
"8784","7","4","Leonard","Maybe they fell in love with him as a puppy and didn't know how big he was gonna be.","00:09:33,821","00:09:38,015",False
"8785","7","4","Sheldon","I think she's a fan of <i>Garfield</i> as well. Oh, darn it, now so am I.","00:09:49,265","00:09:55,493",False

"8811","7","4","Sheldon","You see that cabin there? I read they were illegally squatting on Indian land. Yeah. Personally, I think what we did to the Native Americans was wrong, but this is your favorite show, not mine. Oh, look at little Laura Ingalls, eating that peanut butter sandwich. Peanut butter?! Huh! That's strange, since peanut butter wasn't introduced until the early 1900s.","00:16:11,549","00:16:41,840",True

"8830","7","5","Sheldon","You know, riding with Leonard has gotten a little tedious lately. Th-The only car game he ever wants to play is the Quiet Game. And he's terrible at it. I always win.","00:00:54,206","00:01:05,054",True
"8831","7","5","Amy","Well, this project would have us working in close proximity to one another. And there's the vulgar adage that one should not defecate where one eats.","00:01:09,916","00:01:18,572",False

"8839","7","5","Howard","Would you please tell him this isn't a good idea?","00:03:06,738","00:03:08,471",True
"8840","7","5","Howard","I'm just saying, I'd never want to work with Bernadette. Can you imagine seeing someone all day long and then you're supposed to hang out with them after work, too?","00:03:24,597","00:03:31,670",False
"8841","7","5","Raj","Hold on. We do that all the time. You and I work together and play together.","00:03:31,684","00:03:35,176",False

"8881","7","5","Sheldon","What on earth are you talking about? My behavior in the cafeteria was delightful. Maybe your friend Gunderson needs to head over to IKEA and assemble a sense of humor.","00:12:11,776","00:12:23,434",False

"10301","7","22","Sheldon","Oh, I appreciate the offer, but Arthur is gone and there's nothing I can do about it. When Darth Vader struck down Obi-Wan, did Luke cry like a baby and go to his funeral?","00:04:51,356","00:05:02,000",False

"10307","7","22","Penny","I just never knew anyone that died. I had a pet pig when I was a kid. I mean, when he died, we didn't have a funeral, we had a barbecue.","00:06:26,801","00:06:35,359",False

"10315","7","22","Howard","Okay, so you'd lose most of Jar Jar, all the trade route talk, and the boring senate hearings, which are like watching C-SPAN with monsters.","00:08:34,889","00:08:43,710",True
"10316","7","22","Sheldon","Get rid of the trade route part? Then how would Palpatine get Chancellor Valorum kicked out of office? - Eh. - How would he get himself elected? How? Can we get through one holiday without you saying something ridiculous?","00:08:43,730","00:08:57,247",True

"10956","8","6","Leonard","Well, I can't believe you'd say that. You know how insecure I am about my insecurities.","00:08:04,711","00:08:10,064",True

"11026","8","7","Penny","Okay, what's the big deal? Look, if it helps me make a sale with a physician, I don't think it hurts to flirt a little.

"11059","8","7","Penny","Well, what do you mean why? Look, I make more sales if these doctors think I'm single. I did the same kind of thing as a waitress. The real question is, what is he doing in your apartment?","00:11:53,394","00:12:01,317",False
"11060","8","7","Penny","Okay, he just showed up at my door. Don't you think that's a little weird?","00:12:11,529","00:12:14,997",False

"11089","8","8","Howard","Uh, yeah, she loves that place. Every time they flip a shrimp in the air, she practically leaps out of her seat to catch it. That's why I don't take her to SeaWorld.","00:00:05,576","00:00:15,083",True

"11262","8","10","Penny","Oh, Dan. My boss who didn't want to hire me and now's a little hug machine.  Oh,","00:03:35,840","00:03:40,709",True

"11274","8","10","Leonard","Well, but what if this was a potential breakthrough for him? What if... what if this is the thing that would've finally let him open that bottle of champagne?","00:06:50,234","00:06:57,473",False
"11275","8","10","Raj","Maybe he didn't know what to pair champagne with. Strawberries, caviar, oysters. All good choices.","00:06:57,475","00:07:03,679",True
"11276","8","10","Raj","Yeah, that look right there is why people eat before they come to your parties.","00:07:05,215","00:07:09,818",True
"11277","8","10","Howard","Well, there's no discernible pattern that I can see, but it shouldn't be too hard to run the numbers and check.","00:07:11,856","00:07:18,360",False
"11278","8","10","Leonard","Well, maybe we can get some time on the supercomputer.","00:07:18,362","00:07:20,996",False
"11279","8","10","Howard","Sure. We could try multiple regressions with varying physical and experimental constants.","00:07:20,998","00:07:25,401",False

"11281","8","10","Howard","Ooh, it might be a substitution cipher. We could start with basic cryptanalysis.","00:07:30,141","00:07:34,576",False

"11293","8","10","Raj","I was thinking it might be some sort of interstellar coordinate system, maybe an updated version of Hubble's law. I keep seeing the number 90 repeating. That could be the angle of perturbation of a distant galaxy.","00:10:35,804","00:10:46,413",False
"11294","8","10","Raj","Well, he could have been hit by a bus. You don't know.","00:11:01,330","00:11:04,231",True
"11295","8","10","Prof","Sorry it's not more interesting. On the bright side, you didn't have to listen to his stomach growl for 35 years.","00:11:05,733","00:11:12,272",False
"11296","8","10","Leonard","So, was there anything that Professor Abbott worked on during his life that came close to an accomplishment?","00:11:12,274","00:11:17,511",False

"11301","8","10","Penny","Oh, come on, they don't hate you, all right? They're just a little intimidated. All you need to do is show everyone how sweet you really are.","00:12:08,497","00:12:14,367",False
"11302","8","10","Sheldon","And if I may get serious for a moment, hosting this show has been... one crazy ride.","00:13:02,817","00:13:12,993",False

"11310","8","10","Bernadette","No, she's right, and I just want you to know that from now on, I'm gonna be much more sensitive. I don't want anyone walking on eggshells around me.","00:15:24,893","00:15:31,731",False
"11311","8","10","Dan","Oh, well, okay, then, uh, one thing I've been meaning to tell you is that the company is gonna stop paying for our coffee.","00:15:31,733","00:15:39,005",False

"11316","8","10","Leonard","Mm. I know how you feel. I spent the day throwing out a man's entire career, and all that's left is an old bottle of champagne and a naked lady pen that Raj took when he thought no one was looking.","00:17:19,141","00:17:30,650",True

"11336","8","11","Howard","And tell them that we compromised all the equipment? Let's just get it out of here before anyone knows.","00:02:58,829","00:03:04,065",False

"11345","8","11","Sheldon","Because in the last ten minutes, Santa came to town, kissed Mommy and ran Grandma over with a reindeer. I had a drunk uncle who did all those things. Nobody sings songs about him.","00:05:04,821","00:05:16,264",True
"11346","8","11","Bernadette","Maybe you'd like it more if you thought of Santa as a superhero and his power is bringing joy to children.","00:05:16,266","00:05:22,403",False
"11347","8","11","Sheldon","My uncle was accused of that, too. It turned out to be legal in Oklahoma.","00:05:22,405","00:05:28,209",True

"11354","8","11","Leonard","Because you do this kind of thing all the time, and then you try to cover it up.","00:07:32,235","00:07:36,371",False
"11355","8","11","Leonard","What about when you flipped the Mars Rover, or lost Koothrappali's dog, or almost drove off with that baby?","00:07:38,375","00:07:45,013",True

"11363","8","11","Amy","Well, there's a fun one called Ball of Wool. You take a ball of wool, and you put it right in the center of the table. Then people sit on opposite sides of the table and try to blow the wool off.","00:08:48,995","00:09:03,874",True
"11364","8","11","Howard","You know what I think your problem is? You're jealous because you and I used to be best friends until Koothrappali came along.","00:09:11,751","00:09:18,789",False
"11365","8","11","Howard","You know, maybe I'm best friends with Raj because he doesn't think he's smarter than me.","00:09:25,131","00:09:29,200",False

"11367","8","11","Raj","All I'm gonna say is you guys need to stop this right now. It-It's bad enough that my parents are fighting, now I have to hear the two of you? And who cares who's smarter? If it's Leonard or me or... you know, it's Christmas, let's say it's Howard.","00:09:34,641","00:09:47,918",True

"11899","8","18","Sheldon","I don't believe it matters what the topic is. What's crucial for a salon is that we conduct the discussion in an elevated and insightful way. It's all about the execution.","00:15:40,783","00:15:51,260",False
"11900","8","18","Leonard","Of course you'd focus on that rather than the inspiration. Uh, new salon topic. What's more important, an idea or its execution?","00:15:51,262","00:15:59,567",False
"11901","8","18","Sheldon","Yeah, good for you, Leonard. That's a lovely little notion.

"11934","8","19","Sheldon","So it's like the musical equivalent of Russell's Paradox, the question of whether the set of all sets that don't contain themselves as members contains itself?","00:05:28,026","00:05:37,490",False

"12231","8","23","Bernadette","Okay, I don't know when I became the mother to three lazy teenagers, but it stops today. You guys are cleaning the kitchen, top to bottom.","00:07:57,165","00:08:04,538",False

"12239","8","23","Leonard","Yes, and we'll get back to that. But, uh, even with your mother here, you are deliberately hogging all the attention from my mom. You're like one of those elephant seal pups that steals the milk from two mothers!","00:09:41,470","00:09:53,413",True
"12240","8","23","Sheldon","Do you mean what marine biologists refer to as ""super weaning""?","00:09:53,415","00:09:58,485",False
"12241","8","23","Sheldon","Well, now I have to correct you. A-As a bit of an elephant seal buff, the more accurate comparison would be when two mother seals actively seek to nourish the same pup.
